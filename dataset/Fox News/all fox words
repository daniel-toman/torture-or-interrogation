Quotation
Anyway,
Gitmo,
I
think
they
are
serving
ice
cream
now
and
they're
probably
watching
me
now
on
the
big
screen
TVs.
Indonesia,
the
world's
most
populous
Islam
nation,
told
the
U.S.
it
needs
a
better
job
of
promoting
religious
tolerance.
Do
we
now?
Some
of
the
other
allegation
and
input,
believe
it
or
not,
come
from
Americans
themselves.
Now,
who
do
you
think
might
have
been
over
there
this
Friday?
Well,
network
of
U.S.
non-governmental
organizations.
They're
over
there.
One
of
these
groups
is
the
U.S.
Human
Rights
Network.
It's
made
up
of
activists,
organizations
whose
goal
it
is
to,
quote,
"In
full
compliance
with
universal
human
rights
standards
in
the
U.S.,
it
will
require
the

of
a

Transforming
America.
Where
have
I
heard
that
before?
And
who
is
funding
the
effort?
Well,
the
Human
Rights
Fund
is
funded
by
a
group
of
donors
and
philanthropies
including
George
Soros'
Open
Society
Institute
over
in
Geneva
-
were
you,
Georgie?
Now,
pay
close
attention
here
because
Soros
also
gave
$100
million
to
the
Human
Rights
Watch,
not
to
be
confused
with
the
Human
Rights
Fund.
Sometimes
they
get
confusing
like
that,
almost
intentionally.
An
entirely
separate
group.
Human
Rights
Watch
also
submitted
its
opinions
to
the
U.N.
Do
you
know
who
sits
on
the
board
of
Human
Rights
Watch?
Bernadine
Dohrn
-
Mrs.
Bill
Ayers,
you
know,
the
bombers,
the
terrorists
from
the
'70s.
She
is
vice
chair
of
the
Children's
Rights
Division
You
know,
I
think
that
the
real
terrorist
is
the
American
government
-
state
terrorism
unleashed
against
the
world.
Yes,
yes.
That's
some
audio
you
really
need
to
see.
Well,
George
Soros,
working
against
the
interest
of
America
in
every
possible
conceivable
way.
Who
else
has
sent
their
ideas
to
Geneva?
Who
else,
but
the
AFL-CIO
and
SEIU?
More
on
tomorrow's
episode.
I
mean,
look,
Bill,
I'm
not
a
bigot.
You
know
the
books
I
have
written
about
the
civil
rights
movement
in
this
country.
But
when
I
get
on
a
plane,
I
have
got
to
tell
you,
if
I
see
people
in
Muslim
garb
and
I
think
they
are
identifying
themselves
first
and
This
is
not
a
reflection
on
his
comments.
This
is
not
a
debate,
you
know.
Juan
feels
the
way
he
feels.
That
is
not
for
me
to
pass
judgment
on
that.
That
is
really
his
feelings
that
he
expressed
on
FOX
News
are
really
between
him
and
his,
you
know,
psychia

it
is
not
compatible
with
a

analyst
with
the
role
of

terminating
its
contract
with
Juan
Williams
as
a
news
analyst
after
something
he
said
on
Bill
O'Reilly's
show
on
Monday
night.
Juan
says
he
call
a
call
from
Ellen
Weiss,
NPR's
senior
vice
president
for
news,
Wednesday
evening.
She
said,
you
know,
this
has
been
decided
up
the
chain.
I
said,
I
mean
I
don't
get
the
chance
to
come
in
and
we
do
this
eyeball
to
eyeball,
person
to
person,
have
a
conversation?
I
have
been
there
for
more
than
10
years.

She
said
there
is
nothing
you
could
say
that
would
change
my
mind.
This
has
been
decided
above
me
and
we
are
terminating
your
contract.
Now,
think
of
what
Juan
has
said.
It's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
statement.
He
talks
about
a
feeling
he
has
when
he
sees
a
person
in
Muslim
garb.
And
then
he
spoke
explicitly
about
how
it's
related
to
empirical
reality.
The
empirical
reality
we
all
know
th
I
would
like
to
hear
one
executive
at
NPR
defend
that.
If
not,
this
is
not
just
a
case
of
political
correctness.
It's
a
case
of
intellectual
cowardice.
So,
here
she
is
taking
not
only
an
ideological
position
or
a
philosophical
position,
but
an
expressly
partisan
position.
Now,
the
position
of
Vivian
Schiller,
the

of

was
that

One
interesting
comment
about
Bill
Clinton
in
this.
And
you
are
very
appreciative
of
it.
And
it
was
either
Abu
Ghraib
or
Guantanamo.
.and
the
abuse
scandals.
And
he
said,
apparently
pulled
you
aside
and
said
anyone
who's
making
that
allegation
is
not
a
right-thinking
person.
And
you
felt
very
appreciative
of
it.
I
did.
We
were
at
the
World
War
II
memorial
for
the
dedication.
And
he
walked
across
a
tent,
you
know,
30,
40
feet
across
there,
and
stuck
out
his
hand
and
said,
you
will
get
through
this.
No-one
right
thinking
person
would
have
any
--
even
begin
to
think
How
well
do
you
know
the
current
president?
You
did
write
about
Barack
Obama
that
once
he
assumed
the
responsibilities
of
being
commander
in
chief
in
2009
he
found
that
making
policy
was
much
different
from
making
speeches.
And
you're
referring
to
Guantan
No.
During
the
campaign,
he
and
his
opponent
both
were
quite
critical
of
the
Bush
administration.
And
president,
now
president
but
candidate
Obama
was
critical
of
Guantanamo.
He
was
critical
of
indefinite
detention
for
unlawful
combatants.
He
was
critical
Yes.
What
about
Abu
Ghraib?
You've
mentioned
it
earlier.
And
what
about
Guantanamo
and
the
debate
that
came
up?
Because
you
are
very
defensive
about,
both.
You
claim
you
did
not
know
about
Abu
Ghraib,
and
Guantanamo,
I
think
the
chapter
title
was,
you
kno
The
least
worse
place.
The
least
worse
place.
It
is
not
a
bad
term,
but
it
is
not
perfect.
When
you
say
the
word
war,
American
people
think
of
big
armies,
navies
and
Air
Force.
They
don't
think
of
dealing
with
non-state
entities
like
terrorist
networks.
They
don't
think
of
operating
in
countries

What
I'm
saying
the
numbers
that
believe
in
radicalism,
I'm
separating
the
two.
Exactly,
the
numbers
who
are
radical
Islam
is
relatively
small,
it's
a
small
fraction
of
that
population.
And
I
think
that
it
being
critical
of
our
own
administration,
the
Bush
administration.
We
did
not
do
a
great
job
of
engaging
in
the
battle
of
ideas,

Do
you
think
the
country
got
war
weary?
Do
you
think
America
forgot?
Because
time
sort
of,
you
know,
distant
memories,
because
when
people
talk
about
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
now,
there
seems
to
a
lot
of
consensus
among
a
lot
of
people,
there
was
a
lot
of
dem
Well,
let
there
be
no
doubt,
there
are
extremists
out
there,
who
are
determined
to
do
damage
to
the
United
States
of
America.
And
to
kill
Americans,
and
to
impose
a
caliphate
over
a
large
fraction
of
this
globe.
And
they
have
weapons
of
increasingly
fatal
Yes,
you
know,
the
worst,
one
of
the
worst
was
the
statement
in
the
press
that
someone
in
Guantanamo
had
flushed
the
Koran
down
the
toilet.
You're
right
about
that.
And
yet,
the
effect
and
immediate
reaction
in
the
Congress
was
so
negative
and
harmful,
that
it
damaged
the
world's
view
of
the
American
military,
who
are
wonderful
people,
doing
a
great
job.
It
gave
ammunition
to
the
edge
me
to
go
out
and
raise
money
and
I
felt
accountability
in
the
military
was
important.
The
way
we
are
structured
there
was
not
a
good
person
to
fire.
I
decided
I
should
go
to
the
president
and
say
look,
it
is
harmful
to
the
country,
this
event.
I'm
-
-
it
happened
on
my
watch.
I
think
I
s
I
went
back
for
a
few
days
later.
I
wrote
out
a
logical
reason
as
to
precisely
why
I
thought
I
should
resign
and
that
the
country
would
be
better
off
and
that
the
military
would
be
better
off,
the
Pentagon.
And
that
he
would
be
better
off.
Now,
they're
saying
that
I'm
crazy
for
saying
a
caliphate
is
coming.
I'm
talking
about
Islamic
socialism.
That's
crazy
fearmongering.
Socialist
and
communists
are
working
together.
Muslim
Brotherhood
is
dangerous.
And
I
say
that
the
Egypt
crisis
is
just
s
OK.
Basically
that
Islamic
radicals
around
the
world
want
a
global
government
of
Shariah
law
and
that's
a
bad
seed
in
Egypt,
and
extremists
in
the
Middle
East
are
linking
hands
with
socialists
and
communists
to
destabilize
the
world.
Once
that
destabiliza
I
never
said
it
was
the
end
of
the
world.
I
said
you
don't
know.
So,
let's
take
this
apart
piece-by-piece.
So,
you
have
it,
because
you
have
to
carry
it.
These
guys
aren't
doing
the
work
anymore.
But
basically,
if
we
take
this
apart,
it's
really
--
it's
really
three
things
here.
It's
three
things.
It's
extremists.
It's
Shariah
law.
Global
caliphate.
It's
extremists,
it's
Islamic
extremist
and
communist
and
destabilization.
I
showed
this
on
the
fir
The
theory
is
radical
Islamists,
communist
and
socialists
will
work
together
against
Israel,
will
work
together
against
capitalism
and
work
together
to
overturn
stability.
That's
it.
They'll
overturn
stability
because
in
the
status
quo,
they
are
ostracize
Now,
let's
see
if
any
of
this
true.
Let's
go
back
here,
I'm
running
-
-
let's
go
back
to
"Glenn
Beck
is
crazy."
Why
am
I
crazy?
First
one
is
I'm
saying
a
global
caliphate
is
coming.
I
don't
know
when.
I
don't
even
know
if
it
will
happen.
I'm
just
saying
you're
creating
the
conditions
that
make
it
more
likely.
It
sounds
ridiculous
and
crazy.
Nobody
is
talking
about
it.
So,
let's
go
to
that
charge.
Let's
start
with
Paul
Bremer,
the
former
ambassador
at
large
for
counterterrorism.
Quote,
"Islamic
extremists
are
a
threat
not
only
to
the
U.S.
but
to
the
entire
globe.
These
extremists
have
a
vision
of
a
world
converted
to
Is
Then
we
go
to
the
nutjob
in
Iran,
Ahmadinejad.
"Our
revolution's
main
mission
is
to
pave
the
way
for
the
reappearance
of
the
12th
imam,
the
Mahdi."
Caliphate.
Look
up
the
12th
imam.
You'll
see
it.
The
Party
of
the
Liberation,
the
Hizb
ut-Tahrir
--
this
one
we
told
you
about
last
night
--
offshoot
of
the
Muslim
Brotherhood.
Active,
40
different
countries.
They
were
inspired
mostly
to
push
for
a
new
caliphate.
The
Taliban
leader
al-Zawahiri.
Remember
this
guy?
He
was
trained,
I
believe,
by
the
Muslim
Brotherhood.
He's
an
offshoot
here.
He's
a
disciple.
He
said,
"Nothing
would
be
more
disturbing
than
the
--
nothing
more
than
disturbing
acts
regardless
of
their
magnitude
unless
they
led
to
a
caliphate
in
the
heart
of
the
Islamic
world."
Osama
bin
Laden
says
Muslims
need
a
leader
who
can
unite
them
and
establish
the
pious
caliphate.
Blahdi,
blahdi,
blahdi.
He
says,
"We're
against
communism
as
well."
Yes,
they
are,
in
the
end.
We
want
the
revival
under
the
nation,
under
the
Islamic
calipha
We
read
it.
This
is
the
--
this
is
the
CIA
analysis.
And
they
mapped
out
a
global
future
and
mapped
out
a
scenario
how
a
global
movement
fueled
by
radical
religious
identity
could
emerge.
Under
the
scenario,
a
new
caliphate
is
proclaimed
and
manages
to
ad
And,
basically,
they
say
this
report
is
naive.
There's
a
lack
of
understanding
on
behalf
of
the
U.S.
government
on
the
long
range
goals
of
the
caliphate.
OK.
So,
back
in
2004,
the
CIA
is
reporting,
preparing
this
report,
a
Web
site
whose
name
in
Arabic
is
caliphate,
says
the
report
doesn't
dig
deep
enough
into
their
plan
for
a
global
caliphate
and
I'm
being
labeled
crazy
or
paranoid
by
these
people.
I'm
never
going
to
expect
these
guys
to
actually
do
their
homework.
They're
not.
They're
comfortable
in
their
jobs.
They're
comfortable
with
their
titles
and
that's
just
the
way
it's
going
to
be.
They
had
their
time
in
the
sun.
One
more
thing
before
we
leave
the
first
charge
that
Glenn
is
crazy
for
saying
the
caliphate
is
coming.
I
just
showed
you
the
CIA
report
and
all
the
people
asking
for
it
and
all
of
this
information
at
GlennBeck.com.

But
one
more
piece
of
evidence.
And
it
only
--
it
was
only
on
"The
Rush
Limbaugh
Show"
today
with
the
former
secretary
of
defense,
Donald
Rumsfeld.
Here's
what
he
said
today
about
a
global
caliphate.
Listen
carefully.
We
are
up
against
a
vicious
enemy.
The
radical
Islamists
are
there.
They
intend
to
try
to
create
a
caliphate
in
this
world
and
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
nation
states.
And
we're
reluctant
to
engage
in
the
competition
of
ideas
and
point
out
what
th
That's
what's
happening
here.
These
people
are
not
willing
to
look
at
the
reality
and
have
an
open
dialogue.
It's
the
same
thing
that
happened
when
we
said
there's
communist
in
the
White
House.
They
just
brushed
him
out
at
night.
No,
have
the
dialogue.
That
brings
us
to
charge
number
two.
Charge
number
two
is
socialism
--
Islamic
socialism
and
socialist
communists
working
together,
along
with
radical
Islam.
Now,
I
showed
you
how
--
there
are
different
groups
uniting
with
Egypt
on
the
principle
of
destroying
capitalism
--
this
is
going
to
blow
your
mind
--
destroy
capitalism
and
the
Western
way
of
life
and
how
they
are
put
their
end
game
differences
aside
to

And
this
is
what
critics
apparently
for
some
reason
don't
want
you
to
look
at.
Watch
this.
This
is
the
left.
The
"fall
of
capitalism"
and
the
"rise
of
Islam"
--
they're
both
uniting
on
the
fall
of
capitalism
and
destabilization.
One
wants
the
rise
of
Islam.
And
again,
the
name
of
the
conference
in
English
is
the
"Caliphate
Conference."
By
the
way,
it
was
only
in
Illinois.
So,
now,
let
me
ask
you
--
if
you
compared
what
the
people
who
are
on
the
street
in
Chicago,
Illinois,
the
socialists,
and
this,
and
you
just
took
out
the
word
"Islam,"
which
one
was
the
radical
extremist
from
Islam
and
which
one
was
the
radical
communist
Tonight,
we
are
-
we've
got
to
get
back
to
Islamic
socialism,
because
these
are
just
syllabuses
of
classes
that
are
happening
in
universities
around
the
country
on
Islamic
socialism.
Tonight,
I
want
to
be
the
show
of
record
here.
Excuse
me.
And
I
look
at
the
charges
that
the
left
and
the
right
are
leveling
against
this
program
for
showing
you
the
facts
and
asking
you
to
engage
in
some
critical
thinking.
It's
scary
crazy
because
I
say
the
caliphate
is
coming.
We
are
to
deal
with
that.
Islamic
socialism
-
socialists
and
communists
are
working
together.
Muslim
Brotherhood
is
dangerous
-
is
where
we
are.
Someone
is
being
less
than
honest
here,
or
at
least
deliberately
misleading
you.
Quite
honestly,
it's
because
we
challenge
them.
We
challenge
them
for
their
position
or
power.
I
mean,
really,
no.
There
is
not
much
of
a
challenge
there,
but
they
feel
challenged.
But
it's
not
really
about
me.
It's
not
about
them.
It's
about
you.
It's
about
whether
you
are
going
to
be
empowered
with
information,
and
can
you
find
information
by
yourself.
I
could
walk
out
of
the
studio
today
and
get
hit
by
a
bus.
What
is
this
show
or
anything
else
if
that
happens?
Unless
you've
taught
yourself
how
t
I'm
asking
you
again
tonight
to
do
your
homework.
We
have
laid
out
the
charges
already.
The
next
one
is
the
Muslim
Brotherhood.
They're
not,
they're
not
dangerous!
Right.
They
retread
just
a
little
bit
here
from
last
night,
but
there
is
some
new
amazing
v
But
I
want
you
to
know
it
and
to
share
it,
because,
apparently,
the
left,
the
administration,
some
on
the
right,
the
leader
of
this
movement
in
Egypt
are
all
perfectly
comfortable
with
the
Muslim
Brotherhood.
Now,
here
is
David
Cornyn
-
I
mean,
you
want
to
talk
about
a
fringy.
He
is
from
"Mother
Jones."
Yes,
they
are
still
in
business,
calling
me
crazy
for
saying
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
is
dangerous.
Then,
we
have
Glenn
Beck
who
is
literally
off
the
charts.
What
does
he
say?
He
quite
literally
says
on
the
show,
this
is
not
about
these
people.
This
is
not
about
freedom.
This
is
not
about
democracy.
This
is
about
a
conspiracy
to
have
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
take
over,
not
just
Egypt,
but
all
of
Europe
and
threaten
the
United
States
while
working
with
the
leftist
groups.
He
is
cheapening
their
action
and
their
sacrifice.
It's
beyond
shame.
It's
beyond

Really,
David?
That's
why
you
work
for
"Mother
Jones"
and
I
work
here.
The
night,
night
one,
we
showed
the
similarities
between
Egypt
2011
and
Iran
1979.
That,
too,
was
all
about
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
risking
their
lives
in
favor
of
democracy
an
But
what
happened?
How
is
that
democracy
working
out
in
Iran?
How
is
the
democracy
working
anywhere
in
the
Middle
East
outside
of
Israel?
Show
me
the
Democratic
model
in
the
Islamic
world.
Here
is
where
it
falls
apart.
We
covered
a
little
bit
of
this
last
night.
Eighty-two
percent
of
those
in
Egypt
believe
adulterers
should
be
stoned.
Eighty-four
percent
believe
apostates
of
Islam
should
face
the
death
penalty
if
they
leave
Islam.
Eighty
fo
That's
Sharia
law.
It
is
not
democracy.
Now,
I'm
going
to
show
you
some
graphic
video,
and
be
forewarned
if
you
have
kids.
We
have
tried
to
mask
it
as
much
as
we
can.
But
I
want
to
show
you
some
-
this
is
Muslim
on
Muslim
crime.
The
people
in
this
video
-
these
are
all
Muslims.
And
they
are
in
this
video
going
to
-
with
machetes,
they
are
hacking
people
to
death
for
not
being
Muslim
enough.
When
you
have
84
percent
of
people
that
want
you
to
be
killed
for
leaving
the
religion
that
you
-
and
you
have
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
who
then
will
say,
"I'm
going
to
feed
you.
I'm
going
to
protect
you.
Come
to
me."
You
can
be
for
democracy,
but
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
democracy.
They
already
believe
in
Sharia
law.
All
you
need
is
just
a
couple
of
things
to
go
wrong
and
you
have
another
Iran.
It
is
trouble.
And
for
those
who
are
incapable
of
actually
hearing
and
listening
to
the
words
that
I'm
speaking
right
now,
I
have
not
said
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
would
take
over
all
of
Europe
or
threaten
the
U.S.
I
have
said
that
they
are
a
threat
to
the
entire
globe
as
are
all
Muslim
radicals,
as
are
all
communists.
Anybody
who
wants
to
violently
overthrow
the
government
of
the
United
States
is
a
danger.
What
I
have
said
is
that
once
you
have
destabilization
and
the
dominoes
begin
to
fall,
if
radical
extremists
see
the
opportunity
and
see,
"Oh,
my
gosh
it
happened
in
Egypt,
we
can
make
it
happen,"
and
you
start
to
have
country
after
country
rise
up,
it
ca
And
it
can
also
spread
to
Europe
because
Europe
is
already
unstable.
That's
the
goal
-
destabilization.
I've
not
said
that
they're
taking
over
America
this
week.
I
said
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
is
significant
in
its
presence
here.
They
have
influence
all
over
the
world.
I've
shown
you
last
night
or
the
night
before
50
chapters
of
the
Muslim
American
Society.
That
is
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
here
in
America.
My
concern
-
once
the
dominoes
start
to
fall,
how
far
do
they
go?
Is
anybody
informed
enough
to
stop
and
hold
on
to
dominoes?
They
need
instability
and
revolution
to
gain
power.
But
listen
to
the
people
feeding
you
information
every
day.
Listen.
We
talked
about
the
Muslim
Brotherhood,
if
they
would
play
a
role.
It
was
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
experts
on
the
panel
that
they
will
also
be
aware
of
their
position
internationally,
so
they
don't
want
to
overstep
that.
They
don't
want
to
turn
it
to
the
Islamist
state,
but
they
have
matured
politically
in
that
sense
and
are
rather
sophisticated.
Really?
I
mean,
it
would
be
nice
to
believe
that.
But
where
are
the
facts
besides
what
they
say?
I'll
state
them
again.
This
is
a
group
that
birthed
Hamas
and
al-Qaeda.
Al-Qaeda's
operational
and
strategic
commander
was
a
member,
Mohamed
Atta,
a
9/11
terrorist,
was
a
member.
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
mastermind
of
9/11,
the
man
who
personally
murdered
Daniel
Pearl.
Do
you
remember
that?
Member
-
are
they
a
threat
to
the
U.S.?
Oh,
yes.
But
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
that.
You
can
go
with
David
Gregory,
who
I
know
can
ask
questions
in
French.
It's
fabulous.
But
you
decide.
Their
stated
goal
in
the
U.S.,
may
I?
The
Iquan,
which
means
"the
brotherhood"
in
Arabic,
"Iquan
must
understand
that
their
work
in
America
is
kind
of
a
grand
jihad
in
eliminating
and
destroying
the
western
civilization
from
within
and
sab
I
don't
know.
I'd
love
to
go
with
David
Gregory,
but
I
think
-
I
think
after
we
saw
the
towers
come
down,
we
might
want
to
have
a
few
more
facts.
Maybe
it's
just
me.
The
Muslim
Brotherhood.
Yes.
And
the
AFL-CIO.
Stand
by
all
of
it.
But
it's
not
a
conspiracy.
And
they're
not
necessarily
coordinating
everything.
They're
like
minded.
What
do
these
guys
want?
Muslim
Brotherhood.
Hezbollah.
Do
we
have
the
Hezbollah
one?
And
this
guy
-
what
does
he
want?
They're
all
looking
for
the
same
thing.
This
guy
may
just
want
a
new
banking
-
I
don't
know
what
exactly
his
is
like.
They
want
a
caliphate.
They
want
a
communist
or
socialist,
but
they
all
say
a
new
world
order
is
coming.
This
is
about
the
end
game.
They
all
agree
that
the
world,
as
we
know
it,
under
capitalism,
is
over
-
is
over.
So
what
is
it
going
to
be?
Who
has
the
biggest
coalition?
Bill
Ayers
and
Bernadine
Dohrn,
Code
Pink
founders,
Jodie
Evans
helped
organize
the
Free
Gaza
Movement
which
launched
the
Gaza
flotilla
ships
along
with
the
members
of
the
Muslim
Brotherhood.
What
was
that
about?
Destabilization.
What
about
the
unions?
Why
would
the
union
be
involved
with
these
guys?
Destabilization.
Let
me
show
you.
AFL-CIO,
Richard
Trumka
-
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)
when
we
come
back,
this
we're
going
to
try.
I'll
show
it
when
we
come
back.
It
will
blow
your
mind.
Next.
The
Obama
administration
which
one
hard-pressed
to
find
countries
willing
to
welcome
released
Gitmo
detainees
on
their
shores.
And
now,
a
city
right
here
in
America
is
on
the
verge
of
opening
its
doors
to
them.
Tonight,
the
Berkeley
City
Council
will
vote
And
joining
me
with
reaction,
the
chief
counsel
for
the
American
center
for
law
and
justice,
Jay
Sekulow.
And
Holly
Harwood,
the
supporter
of
this
initiative.
She
is
the
chapter
coordinator
of
the
Golden
State
Chapter
of
Code
Pink
Women
for
Peace.
All
right.
Holly,
really,
you
want
them
dating
your
cousin?
You
want
them
living
next
door
to
you?
The
detainees.
Would
you
like
--
well,
maybe
they
can
move
into
your
house
if
they
don't
have
a
place
to
live?
Yes,
they
can
move
into
my
house.
We
have
a
spare
bedroom
set
up,
yes.
I
dispute
your
statistics
about
the
numbers
who
allegedly
went
back
to
terrorism.
Unless
you
count
suing
over
your
torture
as
terrorism.
I
think
personally
going
through
court
of
law
i
Excuse
me
Holly,
you
can't
--
don't
question
my
statistics.
This
is
from
the
director
of
National
Intelligence.
If
you
ever
--
with
the
director
of
the
National
Intelligence,
I'm
sure
you
are
a
big
Obama
supporter,
take
it
up
with
them.
Oh,
you're
not
a
big
Obama
supporter.
All
right.
Jay,
look.
If
it
weren't
so
serious
this
would
be
comical.
And
if
Holly
wants
them
all
to
move
in
her
house,
that's
fine.
She
can
have
them.
But
what
about
the
safety
and
security
of
making
sure
that
radical
or
Islamists
don't
live
on
our
shores?
Well,
actually,
the
answer
is,
she
doesn't
get
to
make
that
choice.
Because
under
our
law,
is
the
federal
government
that
makes
the
decision
where
these
terrorists
or
formerly
held
terrorists
or
those
accused
of
terrorism
that
were
in
Gitmo
are
going
to
b
And
Sean,
as
you
said,
his
own
National
Intelligence
director
has
stated
that
upwards
of
25
percent
definitely
without
question
have
returned
to
terrorist
activities.
And
there
are
reports
as
you've
said
that
81
percent
return
to
some
form
ever
recidivism
And
by
the
way,
let
me
just
clarify,
they
have
assessed
that
81
are
confirms,
69
are
suspected
of
re-engaging
in
terrorist
activities.
I
think
I
said
percentage,
I
made
a
mistake.
But
my
point
to
you
is,
Holly,
I'm
just
having
a
hard
time
understanding,
y
I
have
no
idea
what
goes
on
in
Obama's
mine.
I
want
to
know
why
Jay
thinks,
that
the
Bush
and
Obama
administrations
are
wrong
to
say
these
men
are
cleared.
If
they
are
cleared,
they
can
go
back
to
the
community.
Yes,
they
are
cleared.
Not
cleared
to
come
back
--
hold
it.
First
of
all,
understand
what
the
law
is.
First
of
all,
cleared
does
not
mean
they
are
not
guilty.
Cleared
means
it
could
have
been
an
evidentiary
issue.
They
may
have
been
sufficient
evidence
--
hold
on,
they
may
have
They
can't
be
returned.
Oh
please,
of
course
they
can
be
return.
Because
when
they
do
get
return,
what
happens,
they
go
back
to
their.
Some
of
them
are
afraid
they
will
be
killed
or
tortured
if
they
go
back
to
their
own
country.
Why
would
they
be
killed
or
tortured
if
they
weren't
guilty
of
terrorism?
What
would
they
be
killed
or
torture?
One
is
the
man
who's
--
he
doesn't
want
to
go
back
to
Russia.
Hold
on.
Well,
you
know
what,
sorry.
You
came
to
the
United
States
because
we
picked
you
up
on
a
battlefield,
suspected
you
of
terrorism,
put
you
in
Guantanamo
Bay.
And
if
the
Department
of
Defense
clears
them
again,
not
finding
them
not
guilty
decides
to
You
are
trying
to
make
a
political
decision
out
of
the
military.
Holly,
do
you
acknowledge
there's
a
war
on
terrorism?
I
think
that
it
is
a
war
creating
terrorism.
Whoa,
whoa,
stop
right
there,
I
don't
have
a
lot
of
time.
And
by
the
way,
I
lose
--
family
members
on
September
11th.
So,
don't
tell
me
about
terrorism.
You
lost
family
members,
who
attacked
them?
Saudis.
Our
allies.
Saudis.
No,
al-Qaeda.
And
what
country
were
they
from?
Anyway,
Berkeley
is
asking
the
federal
government
to
lift
the
ban
on
cleared
detainees
and
that
if
they
do,
we
welcome
them.
All
right.
Holly,
last
question,
do
you
agree
that
there
are
terrorist
organizations,
al-Qaeda,
Hezbollah,
Hamas,
the
Muslim
brotherhood,
do
you
view
them
as
terrorist
organizations?
First,
we
have
to
decide
how
we
define
terrorism.
It's
a
yes
or
no
question.
All
right.
Well,
I'll
give
you
--
I'll
give
you
an
answer.
If
for
example,
your
charter
calls
for
the
destruction
of
Israel.
If
you
believe
in
Jihad
or
holy
war
and
strapping
bombs
on
innocent
children
in
the
name
of
God,
believing
Allah
is
going
to
give

Again,
it
depends
on
your
definition.
Sean
just
gave
you
the
definition
of
terrorism.
Sean,
this
is
the
problem.
This
makes
-
you
know
what?
This
shows
you
what
the
problem
is.
When
you
don't
acknowledge
that
you
are
in
a
war,
when
you
can't
name
your
enemy,
you
are
destined
to
defeat
and
to

I'm
not
in
a
war.
They
are
not
sending
them
back
--
they
are
not
letting
them
stay
here
in
the
United
States.
The
reality
is
if
you
listen
to
code
pink,
the
United
States
would
be
won
by
Hamas
or
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
that's
the
problem.
Thanks,
Sean.
That's
silly.
We
weren't
run
by
the
voters.
We
would
probably
move
them
quickly
into
military
jurisdiction
at
Bagram
for
questioning
and
then
eventually
move
them
probably
to
Guantanamo.
It
was
a
striking
response
given
that
Mr.
Obama
promised
to
shut
Guantanamo
detention
camps
as
one
of
his
first
acts
as
president.
That's
probably
the
best
place
for
anybody
to
go
right
now.
I
appreciate
your
honesty
and
straightforwardness.
The
president
remains
committed
to
closing
the
prison
at
Guantanamo
Bay.
We
probably
move
them
quickly
into
military
jurisdiction
at
Bagram
for
questioning
and
then
eventually
move
them
probably
to
Guantanamo.
The
president
remains
committed
to
closing
Guantanamo.
Jay
Carney
as
his
first
day
as
White
House
press
secretary,
first
briefing
I
should
say,
saying
that
the
president
is
committed
to
closing
down
the
detention
facility
Guantanamo
Bay,
Cuba.
What
about
the
contradiction
today.
We're
back
with
the
panel.
Chr
The
statements
aren't
in
conflict.
You
can
send
to
Guantanamo
but
not
be
happy
about
it.
You
can
do
it
in
the
sense
of
high
minded
regret
and
feel
bad
about
doing
it.
I
would
have
to
say
this.
This
is
year
three
of
the
Obama
administration,
it's
starting
to
look
cynical
for
them
to
governor
govern
one
way
and
talk
another
the
it
smacks
of
an
effort
to
please
a
liberal
base
that
is
very
committed
to
this
issue
and
then

Is
there
going
to
be
that
statement.
We've
seen
all
of
this
stuff
and
every
time
the
president
is
asked
about
it,
Mike
Emanuel
asked
about
it
the
last
press
conference,
and
he
said
the
same
things,
the
president
did.
He
said,
you
know
what,
I
can't
close
Guantanamo.
At
least
not
now.
I'm
going
to
still
work
on
it,
but
I
can't
do
it.
I
can
imagine
a
time
in
the
future
but

You
notice
they
haven't
talked
about
setting
up

in

the

is
a

problem
because
so
many
of
the

come
from

we've

was

Two
years
after
the
president
signed
an
executive
order
to
close
the
detention
camp
at

is
a
grows
chorus
of
administration
officials
who
say
it
won't
happen
before
2012.
Republican
Frank
Wolf
posed
the
question.
Do
you
think
it
ill
be
closed
by
the
end
of
the
president's
first
term?
I
don't
know.
We
will
do
all
that
we
can.
Two
weeks
ago
on
the
Hill,
the
defense
secretary
publicly
what
administration
officials
and
analysts
have
said
privately.
The
prospects
for
closing
Guantanamo
as
best
I
can
tell
are
very,
very
low.
Asked
to
clarify,
the
White
House
was
vague.
The
president
is
committed
to
closing
Guantanamo
Bay.
I
don't
have
a
timetable
on
that
process.
Based
on
his
daily
intelligence
briefing,
the
attorney
general
reinforced
the
administration's
position
it's
a
lightning
rod
for
jihadists.
The
existence
of
Gitmo
is
something
they
use
as
recruiting
effort.
It
is
simply
a
fact.
But
Congressional
Republicans
say
history
tells
another
story.
The
first
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
took
place
before
Guantanamo
Bay
was
there.
The
CIA
director
recently
told
Congress
that
Usama
bin
Laden
and
his
number
two
Anwar
al-Zawahiri
would
likely
go
to
military
custody
if
caught.
We
would
probably
move
them
quickly
into
military
jurisdiction
at
Bagram
for
questioning
and
then
eventually
move
them
probably
to
Guantanamo.
Today
the
attorney
general
took
the
statement
and
they
would
deal
with
the
Al-Qaeda
leader
by
committee.
Were
bin
Laden
to
come
into
our
possession,
the
national
security
team
consider
its
obligation
to
make
a
decision
how
he
would
be
treated.
In
previous
budgets,
the
Justice
Department
has
sought
funding
to
prosecute
detainees
in
U.S.
courts
and
to
buy
prison
space
for
them.
Significantly,
that
was
not
the
case
today.
While
the
administration
blames
Congress
for
the
delay
in
closing
Gitmo,
it

One
activist
whose
home
was
raided
urged
the
others
not
to
talk
to
the
FBI.
Hey,
police,
you
hear
that
one?
Don't
talk
to
the
FBI.
Sounds
kind
of
familiar,
doesn't
it?
Build
a
wall
against
the
FBI.
Oh,
that's
right.
This
is
from
CAIR,
another
Islamic

Gang,

bells
are
ringing
louder
than
ever
before.
Bonhoeffer
and
Churchill,
I
believe,
are
in
the
ground
right
now
trying
to
fashion
little
bells
to
ring
themselves.
America's

is
in

It
was
an
assault
on
military
personnel
by
person
carrying
a
heavy
duty
weapon,
an
automatic
weapon,
shouting
jihadist
chants.
If
that
isn't
a
terrorist
act,
I
don't
know
what
is.
The
attack
alone
is
not
a
terrorist
attack?
For
example,
was
the
shooting
of
Congresswoman
Gabby
Giffords
a
terrorist
attack?
You
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
look
at
the
motivation,
and
then
you
make
a
judgment
and
that
is
a
process
as
far
as
I
know
that
is
ongoing.
Jonah,
this
is
what
the
president
said
after
the
Fort
Hood
attacks.
Take
a
listen.
This
morning
I
met
with
FBI
Director
Mueller
and
the
relevant
agencies
to
discuss
their
ongoing
investigation
into
what
caused
one
individual
to
turn
his
gun
on
fellow
servicemen
and
women.
We
don't
know
all
the
answers
yet.

Those
are
the
different
cases
here.

bomber
as
well.
Charles,
last
word.
Is
it
possible
the
president
has
in
him
something,
a
speech
about
radical
Islam
or
the
threat
about
these
radicalized
elements,
as
lone
wolf
as
they
may
be
in
each
instance,
is
it
possible
he
has
that?
No.
I
think
now.
I
think
he
thinks
to
even
speak
about
it
in
terms
of
the
Islam,
even
radical
Islam,
is
to
make
it
a
civilizational
struggle
and
an
attack
on
a
religion
and
exacerbate
the
war
we
are
in.
I
think
he
is
completely
wrong.
I
don't

Andrew,
I
want
to
come
to

before
we

I

a

of
heat
here
in

for
saying
that

compared

McCarthy

Has
the
Congressman
gone
too
far?
We'll
debate
it
next.
Congressman
Peter
King,
the
Republican
chair
of
House
Homeland
Security
Committee,
is
calling
for
hearings
on
the
radicalization
of
Muslim-Americans.
The
hearings
scheduled
for
Thursday
have
created
a
great
deal
of
controversy
with
critics
comparing
them

Congressman
King
says
he's
received
threats,
but
he's
not
backing
down.
We
know
there's
homegrown
terrorists.
We
know
it's
increasing.
We
know
al
Qaeda's
making
concerted
efforts
to
do
it.
And,
to
me,
it's
absolutely
insane
that
this
type
of
opposition
is
to
--
is
developing
the
hearings
which
I
believe
are
absolutely
essenti
Which
he
believes
are
absolutely
essential.
Dr.
Jasser,
to
you
first,
you
obviously
have
conferred
with
Congressman
King's
staff.
You
believe
in
these
hearings.
You're
one
of
the
lead-off
witnesses.
What
are
you
going
to
say
and
why
are
you
going
to
say
it?
Well,
I'm
going
to
say
that,
so
far,
clearly
whatever
our
nation's
been
doing
has
not
been
working.
Secretary
Napolitano
herself
said
that
our
nation
is
at
the
highest
risk
it's
ever
been.
So
if
we
see
a
problem,
we
need
to
walk
it
back
and
look
at
the
root
cause.
We
have
not
been
treating
the
root
cause.
Clearly,
the
American
Muslim
community
and
Muslims
have
been
the
primary
reporters
of
radicals
in
many
instances.
But
we've
still
not
bee
How
is
the
government
--
--
that
feeds
the
ideology.
Understood,
understood.
Before
I
get
to
Jake
Hornberger,
how
does
the
government
get
involved
in
instilling
political
ideology
in
people?
How
could
you
actually
physically
do
that?
Zuhdi,
how
could
you
do
that?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Yes,
I
think
what
you
need
to
do
is
part
of
the
separation
of
mosque
and
state
is
that
our
founding
fathers
were
--
were
very
skilled
in
discussing
the
differences
of
Christianity
and
the
diversity.
Why
can't
we
have
that
same
functional
di
OK.
Jacob
Hornberger,
there's
obviously
nothing
wrong
with
a
discussion.
I
mean,
debate
is
good.
I
mean,
that
actually
enhances
our
knowledge
of
things
that
we
don't
understand.
But
question
for
you.
Does
the
government
have
any
business?
Does
the
Congres
Of
course
not.
And
this
is
exactly
what
our
ancestors
anticipated
with
that
First
Amendment.
There's
a
reason
why
they
specifically
mention
Congress
as
the
biggest
threat
to
freedom
of
religion,
freedom
of
the
press,
and
so
forth
because
that
--
they
knew
They're
really
missing
the
point
here,
Judge.
The
point
is
that
the
investigation
that
they
really
need
to
be
holding
in
Congress
is
the
U.S.
government's
conduct
in
the
Middle
East.
We
now
know
that
the
U.S.
government
has
been
supporting
these
dictatori
And
--
but
what
King
is
doing
is
using
this
demonization
of
Islam
and
the
Muslims
as
a
smokescreen
to
continue
those
policies
and
then,
of
course,
since
he's
chairman
of
the
Homeland
Security
Agency,
to
justify
the
continuation
of
the
infringements
on

Right.
Zuhdi,
are
people
testifying
of
their
own
free
will
or
are
people
testifying
against
their
will
at
Congressman
King's
hearings?
On
our
own
free
will.
I
mean,
this
is
our
mission.
This
is
why
I
formed
our
organization
is
Congressman
King
is
giving
Muslims
a
platform
to
do
the
self-repair.
I
mean,
the
smokescreen
is
actually
all
the
issues
that
Jacob
just
brought
up
that
are
complet
We're
talking
about
a
radicalization
problem
that
only
Muslims
can
fix.
It's
a
Muslim
problem
that
needs
a
Muslim
solution.
The
vast
majority
of
Muslims
want
to
be
part
of
the
solution,
but
this
is
a
pulpit
and
a
platform
to
do
so.
Jake,
the
problem
really
is
a
lot
bigger
than
Congressman
King
would
like
to
acknowledge,
isn't
it?
Shouldn't
he
be
looking
into
more
things
than
simply
what
Dr.
Jasser
has
suggested?
I
don't
even
think
he
ought
to
be
looking
at
any
of
the
things
that
Dr.
Jasser
has
suggested.
This
is
not
a
religious
problem.
You
know,
if
the
U.S.
government
were
doing
to
the
Vatican
what
it's
been
doing
in
the
Middle
East,
you'd
have
Catholics
outrage
It's
not
a
religious
problem.
It's
a
U.S.
government
foreign
policy
problem.
Ron
Paul
put
it
best
in
that
famous
presidential
debate.
He
said
they
came
over
here
to
kill
us
because
our
government's
been
over
there
killing
them
first.
And
that's
what
we
need
to
be
focused
on.
What
our
government
has
been
doing
to
incite
this
anger
and
outrage
against
the
United
States.
Right.
Dr.
Jasser,
would
you
not
concede
that
the
foreign
policy
of
the
United
States
of
America,
whether
it's
our
physical
presence
in
the
Middle
East
or
whether
it's
Guantanamo
Bay,
is
a
propaganda
tool
for
those
who
want
to
radicalize
Muslims
whether
t
Well,
I
think
certain
parts
of
the
foreign
policy
absolutely
as
far
as
supporting
dictatorships
has
been
a
tool
for
radical
Islam
and
also
our
support
even
more
recently
of
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
and
other
Islamist
groups
has
been

But
what
does
Congressman
King
--
what
does
Congressman
King
want
to
do?
What
does
he
hope
comes
out
of
this?
What
can
the
Congress
possibly
do
about
changing
people's
minds,
Dr.
Jasser?
Well,
Judge,
one
of
the
things
I'm
sitting
listening
to
you
that
concerns
me
is
Congressman
King
--
all
the
members
of
this
committee
are
us.
They're
our
government.
Our
nation
has
a
huge
problem.
We
can't
even
have
a
discussion
because
people
get
labeled
What
he's
trying
--
what
I
believe
he's
trying
to
do
is
give
us
as
Muslims
a
platform
to
say,
you
know
what,
the
best
way
to
peel
away
radical
or
ideas
that
Muslims
are
bad
is
to
let
Muslims
lead
the
charge.
The
demonization
of
an
entire
people
of
a
religious
faith.
It's
--
it's
telling
that
the
Japanese-Americans
are
coming
out
against
this
type
of
thing.
They
know
what
it's
like.
They
know
the
feeling
of
this
type
of
demonization.
The
president
has
demonstrated
a
commitment
to
transparency
and
openness
that
is
greater
than
any
administration
has
shown
in
the
past.
We
have
an
administration
that
is
claiming
a
lot
of
credit
for
its
transparency
policies.
But
on
the
other
hand,
those
policies
haven't
left
us
with
a
truly
more
transparent
government.
This
is
not
a
president
who
has
been
transparent.
All
the
facts
show
he
is
less
transparent
than
his
predecessor.
What
about
this
one?
They're
talking
about
it.
We're
back
with
the
panel.
Charles,
the
president
was
scheduled
to
accept
an
award
today
for
transparency
in
government.
It
got
postponed
today.
But
one
of

Washington

goes
beyond

There
is
also
criticism
that
they
have

in
Jackson

across
from
the
White
House
with
lobbyists
because
of
the
proximity.
You
don't
have
to
get
on
the
secret
service
logs
for
going

That
was
just
about
space,
right?
They
just
needed
a
place
to
meet
and
they
couldn't
have
it
in
the
west
wing.
That's
silly.
Those
are
insulting
explanations.
I'm
surprised
to
hear
that
Charles
is
squishy
on
this.
This
is
an
administration
that
is
not
living
up
to
the
own
standards.
As
Charles
notes,
the
president
said
this,
and
he
not
only
said
this,
but
said
it
in
ostentatious
way
in
the
first
week
in
office.
We
tested
this
at
"The
Weekly
Standard"
in
the
first
week
of
the
administration.
We
asked
for
the
numbers
on
Guantanamo
Bay
recidivists.
They
wouldn't
provide
them.
The
Bush
administration
had
provided
them.
This
went
on
for
two
years
and
the
administrati
Democrats
are
holding
hearings
on
the
Islamophobia
as
counter
to
Congressman
Peter
King's
hearings
on
radical
Islam.
But
something
has
recently
surfaced
that
might
have
a
major
impact
on
how
the
hearings
are
viewed.
David
Lee
Miller
has
the
story.
One
day
before
Senator
Dick
Durbin
slated
to
chair
subcommittee
hearing
aimed
at
protecting
the
civil
rights
of
American
Muslims,
a
controversial
picture
surfaced
that
critics
say
undermines
the
hearing.
The
photo,
which
was
posted
on
a
website
belonging
to
a
group
called
The
Mosque
Foundation,
shows
the
Illinois
Democrat
attending
a
meeting
with
mosque
leaders.
According
to
IPT,
the
Investigative
Project
on
Terrorism,
at
least
two
people

met
with

The
picture
says
1,000
words.
This
was
taken
several
weeks
ago,
and
it
reflects
the
fact
that
a
U.S.
senator
is
conferring
legitimacy
on
some
of
the
most
extremist
supporters
of
terrorism
in
the
United
States.
As
for
Senator
Durbin,
he
offers
no
apologies
for
visiting
the
Mosque
Foundation.
A
statement
from
his
spokesman
says
many
other
Illinois
officials
have
also
met
with
the

individuals.

And
once
again,
the
Muslim
problem
in
the
world
is
illustrated
for
all
to
see.
Reaction
to
the
situation
is
interesting.
General
David
Petraeus
is
the
commander
in
Afghanistan.
We
condemn
the
action
of
an
individual
in
the
United
States
who
burned
a
holy
Koran.
That
action
was
hateful,
it
was
intolerant,
and
it
was
extremely
disrespectful.
I
wish
we
could
find
some
way
to
hold
people
accountable.
Free
speech
is
a
great
idea
but
we're
in
a
war.
During
World
War
II,
you
had
limits
on
what
you
could
say
if
it
would
inspire
the
enemy.
Directly
attacking
God.
That's
ridiculous.
The
Bible
is
a
holy
book,
considered
to
be
the
word
of
God
by
Christians
and
Jews,
but
Christians
and
Jews
don't
slaughter
innocent
people
when
the
Bible
is
burned.
Do
they?
But
it
is
Karzai,
Karzai
whom
I
hold
most
responsible.
The
book
burner
in
Florida
is
a
loon,
but
Karzai
holds
a
position
of
responsibility.
He
had
to
know
he
was
whipping
up
dangerous
feelings
when
he
addressed
the
issue
and
for
what
reason?
Politics?
The
So
they
can't
torture
people
and
all
of
that,
you
know,
at
will.
What
happens
if
we
do
pull
out
of
there?
I
mean,
they
reconstitute
the
Taliban
government.
The
al
Qaeda
people
come
back
in
they
do
what
they
did
before
9/11
there.
All
of
the
people
who
die
Well,
that
-
I
think
that
question
should
be
directed
as
Mr.
Bush
and
Mr.
Obama
who
have
decided
not
to
win
the
war
because
they
want
to
win
hearts
and
minds
instead
of
killing
America's
enemy.
Is
it
winnable?
You
would
have
to
go
in
with
a
meat
cleaver
and
kill
a
lot
of
civilians.
Is
it
winnable?
If
you
don't
want
to
win,
sir,
you
don't
go
to
war.
They
lost
--
Bill,
they
lost
because
they
wanted
to
stay.
The
only
mission
in
Afghanistan
was
a
15-month
punitive
operation
to
kill
as
many
as
we
could
and
get
out
with
the
knowledge
we
might
have
to
do
it
again.
All
right.
Now,
Mr.
O'Hanlon,
you
disagree
with
this,
but
the
essential
question
tonight
is,
when
Americans
see
rampaging
Afghans
killing
38
people
because
some
loon
in
Florida
burned
a
Koran.
And
we're
saying
we
are
spending
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
and
losing
thousands
of
American
lives
to
protect
these
people?
What
say
you?
OK,
it's
hard
for
me
to
quantify
what
percentage
of
the
afghan
people
are
reasonable
and
what
percentage
are
not.
You
know,
we
see
these
kinds
of
things
over
and
over
again.
We
know
the
Taliban.
We
know
what
they
do.
Yet,
the
Taliban
has
support
in
that
c
And
I
say,
there's
a
Muslim
problem
in
the
world.
I
gave
a
lot
of
heat
and
a
lot
of
flak
for
that
as
you
both
know,
but
I
think
there
is.
I
don't
see
the
good
Muslims
and
I
absolutely
think
that
most
of
the
Muslim
people
are
good.
I
don't
see
them
counter
But
in
Afghanistan
we
attacked
them
because
the
Taliban
actively
held
al
Qaeda
and
the
Taliban
were
brutal
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
us.
The
way
the
Taliban
treat
women,
treat
any
infidels
is
off
the
chart.
It's
nothing
to
do
with
the
USA.
They
are
villa
Bill,
it's
none
of
our
business.
We
can't
save
the
entire
world.
We
have
enormous
problems
at
home
and
if
the
Afghans
want
to
treat
their
women
the
way
they
do,
let
them.
No
U.S.
Marines
should
die
so
Mrs.
Mohammed
could
vote
that's
a
simple
bottom
line,

Do
you
think
most
of
the
Afghans
are
what
we
see
in
these
demonstrations,
Dr.
Scheuer?
I
think
most
of
the
Afghans
dislike
occupiers.
That
has
been
their
tradition
for
2,700
years.
You
know,
what's
the
guy's
name
--
that
Quran
guy,
the
preacher
that
was
going
to
burn
the
Quran.
I
remember
when
I
was
on
--
on
vacation
and
that
guy
was
out
there
in
--
he
was
going
to
burn
the
Quran
and
I'm
on
vacation
and
what
happens?
The
Pakistani
a
I
got
out
of
the
boat,
and
I
started
walking
back
to
the
house.
And
I
thinking,
where
does
Glenn
Beck
stand
on
this?
How
does
the
Pakistani
ambassador
even
know
who
I
am?
And
then
I
realized,
wait
a
minute,
who
the
hell
do
I
think
I
am
that
I
would
get
ou
Well,
that
ain't
burning
the
Quran.
When
I
saw
Christians
in
front
of
the
White
House
shouting
at
the
man
praying
to
Allah,
who
prays
there
every
day,
I
thought,
what
are
we
doing?
Terry
Jones
was
there.
Terry
Jones.
He's
the
guy
burning
the
Quran.
Don't
hate.
Love
and
pray.
Well
apparently,
Terry
Jones
did
wind
up
burning
the
Quran
after
some
sort
of
mock
trial
and
finding
the
Quran
guilty
of
crimes.
All
Americans
left
and
right
should
find
this
to
be
ridiculous
that
a
book
kills
people.
That's
as

I
guess
we
have
video
of
this
guy,
but
I'm
not
going
to
play
it
for
you
tonight.
I
don't
take
this
guy
seriously
and
you
shouldn't
either.
He's
all
about
giving
him
attention,
and
we're
not
going
to
give
him
any.
I
just
want
to
make
this
point.
This
is
the
answer.
And
it
comes
from
within
inside.
If
I'm
not
mistaken,
Christianity
teaches
us
that
Jesus
came
--
you
had
to
set
father
against
son
and
vice
versa
and
set
things
on
fire,
but
he
didn't
do
it
with
matches.
The
Quran
guy
who
burned
the
book,
he
did
it
with
matches.
Now,
he
tried
--
he
tried
to
do
something
symbolic.
Well,
somebody
else
chose
to
do
a
symbolic
ritual
of
their
own.
He
said
they
didn't
use
a
book,
they
used
people.
According
to
Asian
news
on
March
25th,
a
mob
of
Islamic
extremists
attacked
a
Pentecostal
church
in
India
killing
two
Christians
and
burning
some
of
the
copies
of
the
bible.
Eyewitnesses
say
the
fundamentalists
stormed
the
place
of
worship
looking
to
set

The
attackers
hurled
anti-Christian
slogans
and
a
feeling
of
anger
towards
the
religious
minority
has
spread
all
over
the
Middle
East
in
the
city.
The
pastor
of
the
church
reports
that,
despite
the
condemnation
of
the
burning
of
the
Quran,
the
community
h
Hatred
is
not
good.
I
have
to
tell
you,
I
--
I
have
a
hard
time
sometimes
watching
speeches
or
watching
things
I
think
because
I
really
truly
believe
somebody
is
destroying
my
country.
It
is
very
hard
for
me
not
to
say,
I
hate
that
guy
or
I
hate
that
woma
We
must
not.
We
must
rise
above
it.
The
only
thing
we
can
control
--
we
cannot
control
our
situation.
We
cannot
control
our
world.
We
can't
control
anything.
Geez,
I
can't
control
my
dog,
let
alone
my
children.
The
only
thing
I
can
control
is
our
action
a
This
guy
who's
doing
the
Quran
burning,
he's
not
responsible
for
the
crazy
people,
but
he
is
responsible
for
his
own
actions.
All
of
us
--
all
of
us
are
responsible
for
that
and
the
choices
that
we
make,
even
if
that
choice
is
to
sit
by
silently
and
say
n
I
guess
I
bring
this
to
you
tonight
because
I
think
things
are
getting
spookier
in
the
Middle
East.
Quite
honestly,
I
can't
believe
I'm
saying
that
but
that's
it.
And
the
solution
is
behind
me
and
in
front
of
you.
Love,
faith,
hope,
charity.
Afghan
police
say
they
have
arrested
the
suspected
mastermind
and
19
others
behind
an
attack
on
a
U.N.
office
today
that
killed
seven
of
its
staff.
Protesters
had
gathered
peacefully
outside
the
office,
but
some
grabbed
weapons
from
security
guards,

After
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
of
public
outcry,
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
was
force
to
cave
in
and
give
up
on
his
dream
of
trying
terrorists
in
civilian
courts.
Instead
the
9/11
co-conspirators
will
now
be
tried
in
military
tribunals
at
Guantanamo
Bay
Now
Holder
reluctantly
made
that
announcement
at
press
conference
yesterday.
That
was
dripping
with
arrogance,
watch
this.
After
thoroughly
studying
the
case
it
became
clear
to
me
that
the
best
venue
for
prosecution
was
in
federal
court.
Let
me
be
clear.
I
stand
by
that
decision
today.
Members
of
Congress
simply
do
not
have
access
to
the
evidence
and
other
information
necessary
to
make
prosecution
judgments.
Let
me
be
clear
and
let
me
be
very
clear.
Our
national
security
demands
that
we
continue
to
prosecute
terrorists
in
federal
courts
It
sounds
like
one
angry
defeated
attorney
general
of
the
United
States.
Here
with
reaction
to
the
administration's
flip-flop,
Jay
Sekulow
for
the
American
Center
for
Law
and
Justice,
Fox
News
legal
analyst
Tamara
Holder.
We
are
going
to
lead
by
setting
an
example
for
other
nations
about
how
we
observe
civil
rights
and
human
rights.
We're
going
to
close
Guantanamo,
which
is
why
we're
going
to
close
Guantanamo,
which
is
why
I
will
close
Guantanamo,
which
is
why
I
will
close
All
right,
Sean,
first
of
all,
I
think
that
you
should
give
credit
where
credit
is
due.
It
is
the
right,
it
is
the
Republicans,
it
is
the
Republicans
who
wanted
Guantanamo
shutdown
and
they
did
not
want
anybody
--
Yes.
They
did
not
want
anybody
tried
in
New
York
City.
They
were
afraid
there
was
going
to
be
a
terrorist
attack.
Let
me
finish.
Let
me
finish.
Eric
Holder
went
through
--
Jay,
I
don't
laugh
at
you
and
there
are
reasons
why
I
could.
Listen,
there
are
--
the
evidence
was
terrible,
Sean.
They
used
LSD
and
heroin
to
get
a
coercion
out
of
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
What
Eric
holder
did
was
he
sifted
through
the
evidence
and
he
determined
whether
or
not
somebody
could
be
tried
on
American
soil.
And
you
know,
now
we're
going
to
a
military
tribun
Listen,
personally,
you're
wonderful.
But
I
got
tell
you
something
that
is
the
most
convoluted
interpretation
that
I've
ever
heard
and
here's
the
bottom
line.
Well,
because
basically
they
couldn't
do
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
they
had
to
finally
acknowledge
without
acknowledging
that
Bush
and
Cheney
were
right,
Jay.
Because
they
used
torture
to
get
-
I'm
Jay.
Let
me
make
a
couple
of
points,
Sean.
Number
one,
I'm
glad
they
made
the
decision
they
made.
I
don't
like
the
way
they
said
it.
In
other
words,
the
fact
that
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
is
now
going
to
be
trade
in
Guantanamo
Bay
in
a
military
tribunal
You
don't
like
how
he
said
it?
I'm
sorry.
Sean,
let
me
make
two
points
on
this
very
clear
because
I've
been
a
government
lawyer.
I've
been
a
defense
lawyer.
You
don't
know
and
I'll
give
a
perfect
example,
on
how
any
case
comes
out
even
when
you've
looked
at
the
evidence.
For
instance,
the
Galani
case,
which
was
a
terrorist
trial
in
a
civilian
court
with
individuals
involved
in
East
African
bombing
of
the
U.S.
embassy.
What
happened
there,
285
counts
for
the
indictment,
only
one
conviction
after
the
trial
because
the
judge
Tamara,
I'm
not
talking
to
you.
Sean,
asked
me
a
question
I'm
answering
Sean's
question.
So
that's
number
one.
Number
two,
the
military
justice
system,
our
military
justice
system
is
one
of
the
best
military
justice
systems
in
the
world.
This
is
not
as
if
How
did
he
admit
that?
Excuse
me,
I'm
talking
to
Sean.
I'm
just
wondering.
They
said
that
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
said
that
he
wanted
to
use
the
court
system,
the
civilian
trial
to
make
his
point
about
why
America
must
be
brought
to
its
knees
once
again.
So
the
right
decision
was
made.
It
comported
with
international
law.
Tamara,
why
can't
you
just
admit
that
they
flip-flopped.
That
the
president
didn't
have
either
the
principles
or
the
ability
to
standby
another
campaign
promise?
So
the
reality
of
governing
as
Dick
Cheney
pointed
out
in
2009,
they
would
be
forced
to
do
th
Sean,
I
will
agree
with
you
when
it
is
right.
I
believe
that
Obama,
he
failed
on
a
campaign
promise,
absolutely.
He
said
he's
going
to
close
Guantanamo
down.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
what
did
he
do?
He
and
Eric
Holder
made
the
right
decision.
The
Department
of
Justice,
not
Congress,
by
going
through
evidence
and
saying,
that
test
case,
that
African
bombing
test
case
that
was
a
failure.
Wait
a
minute,
that's
not
what
Eric
Holder
is
saying.
He
actually
said
here
that
he
stands
by
his
position.
Of
course,
he
does
and
I
understand
that
because
terrorists
should
be
tried
under
our
laws
and
our
system.
They
are
not
citizens.
There's
a
situation
where
there
is
coercion
and
torture
and
heroin
and
LSD
and
people
being
forced
to
stand
18
hours
in
the
water,
those
things
are
not
going
to
hold
up
in
court.
The
military
justice
system
in
the
United
States
is
our
laws.
The
military
justice
system
in
the
United
States
is
our
laws.
It
is
adopted
by
our
military,
approved
by
our
Congress.
These
are
laws
that
come
out
of
the
air.
These
are
laws
in
compliance
with
international
law
including
the
Geneva
Convention.
And
what
we
did
here
and
I
think
Lindsey
Graham
said
this
correct
today
--
Evidence
from
torture
is
not
admissible
even
in
the
military
justice,
you
know
that
-
and
exactly
right.
Number
two,
I
think
it
is
critical
here,
the
military
justice
systems
allows
justice
to
go
along
side
of
national
security.
You
are
not
going
to
have

This
very
hypothetical,
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
Tamara.
Let's
say
you
are
in
a
parking
lot
and
you
got
your
child
with
you,
three
guys
run
up
to
you,
grab
your
child
you
grab
one
and
the
child
is
taken
away.
Would
you
not
use
every
means
necessary
to
extract
the
information
from
the
third
guy
that
you
captured
to
find
out
where
your
child
is?
Well,
I'm
not
--
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
question
Sean,
I'm
sorry.
Would
you
take
a
lighter
and
burn
their
hands
until
they
talked?
No,
absolutely
not.
Yes,
of
course,
you
would.
Our
system
of
government
--
you
don't
get
reliable
information,
Sean,
that
way.
I'd
get
the
information
I
wanted,
trust
me.
You
do
not
get
reliable
information
through
torture.
But,
you
know,
it
is
not
about
torture.
It
was
about
justice
and
justice
was
served
tonight.
Well,
the
biggest
short-term
threat
is
clearly
radical
Islamists
and
the
fact
that
they
methodically
get
up
every
day
trying
to
find
ways
to
kill
us.
Wow.
Wait,
wait,
let
me
stop
you
there
did
I
not
know
that
and
I'm
sure
most
of
my
audience
did
not
know.
Explain
how
that
went
down.
How
did
we
get
that
information?
Where
did
it
come
from?
Was
it
Guantanamo
Bay?
It
came
from
an
overseas
prison
where
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
was
being
interrogated
and
water
boarding
was
used
and
it
was
during
the
interrogation
of
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
through
water
boarding
that
this
information
was
learned.
So
--
so
KSM
gave
it
up.
Mohammed
himself
gave
it
up?
KSM
gave
us
then
first
lead
and
then,
later
on
Al-Alibi
(ph)
who

you
look

at

We
got
vital

which

to

The

breaks
a
big
story
last

as
Congressman

was

by

the

over

last

Now,
as

waterboarding
and,
of

interrogation
led

the

of

So
I'm
asking
you.
Did
waterboarding
coerced interrogation
lead
to
bin

demise?
It's
my
understanding,
Bill,
that
the
intelligence

that
we

was
based
on
the

which
came
from

Now,
when
you

Mr.

does
that

that

information
or
this
is
something
you
heard
in

I
think
it's
very
good
intelligence
information
that
the
original
nugget
of
information
surfaced
during
his
first
interview
at
an
out-of-the
country
facility.
Ok
because
that's
what
King
says;
he
said
it
was
out-of-country
facility.
"The
Washington
Post"
backs
that
up
that
this
happened.
Waterboarding
obviously
was
used
on
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
many,
many
times;
so
there
we
go.
We
obtained
that
information
through
waterboarding.
And
so
for
those
who
say
that
waterboarding
doesn't
work,
to
say
it
should
be
stopped
and
never
used
again,
we
got
vital
information
which
directly
led
us
to
bin

Wait,
wait,
let
me
stop
you

I
not
know
that
and
I'm
sure
most
of
my
audience
did
not
know.
Explain
how
that
went
down.
How
did
we
get
that
information?
Where
did
it
come
from?
Was
it
Guantanamo
Bay?
It
came
from
an
overseas
prison
where
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
was
being
interrogated
and
waterboarding
was
used
and
it
was
during
the
interrogation
of
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
through
waterboarding.
Now,
this
morning
the
"The
Washington
Post"
backed
up
Congressman
King's
assertion,
although
the
"Post"
does
not
mention
waterboarding,
it
did
say
rough interrogations
were
used
to
get
the
information.
The
Pentagon
said
that.
A

from
the

said
that
and

it

talking
about?
Candidly
I
don't

let's
go

I

were

I
do
not

Ok.
So
he
doesn't
know.
He
doesn't
want
to

He
doesn't
have
to
say.
Why
don't
you
agree
--
you
don't
believe
the

Donald

You
don't
believe

Because
I
haven't

I
have
not
questioned

If
Rumsfeld
wants
to
come
on

night
and
sit
there
I
will
question
him.
And
then
when
he
says

I
will
decide
whether
to

or
not.
I'm
not
going
to

if

The
point
is
that

And
he's
waterboarded.
And
from
that

on
he
gave

I
just
want
--
I
just
to

this.
All
right,
the

is
standing

Let

I

it

that

during

I
think
it's
certainly
is
a
reasonable
idea.
Is
it
correct
that
the
CIA
Director
Panetta
today
indicated
that
one
of
the
individuals
who
provided
important
information
had
in
fact
been
waterboarded?
Well,
that's
my
understanding.
And
I
think
that
anyone
who
suggests
that
the
enhanced
techniques,
let's
be
blunt,
waterboarding,
did
not
produce
an
enormous
amount
of
valuable
intelligence,
just
isn't
facing
the
truth.
The
facts
are,
a

Yes.
Well,
there
were
only
three
people.
And
that
led
to
the
information
of
the
nickname
of

And
this
by
though
--
we've
had
this
for
years
and
this
was
being
pursued

he
was

You
are

I
also
agree
that
he
made
the
right
decision.
And
rather
than
using
cruise
missiles
or
drones
to
attack
the

I
think
using
the

teams
and
going
in
there
and
actually
getting

him,
knowing
that

I've

I

that

Well,
no.
Let
me
tell
you,
here's
my
view
for
what
we
should
do.
We
should
have
classified

to
CIA
that
are
beyond

--
that

Why
did
you

And
nothing
else.
And
they
were

Unbelievable.

is
not
going
to
keep
the

inside
the

from

Remember,
look,
Al-Qaeda's

obvious
now
that
enhanced interrogations,

black

that
the
harsh questioning
led
to
the
intelligence,
thanks
to
the
Bush

I
think
they
deserve
as
much
credit
for
what
happened
Sunday,
I
said
the
president,
who
I
am
not
a
find
of,
made
a
gutsy
decision
going
in
the
way
so
we
could
have
confirmation
that
it
was
Bin

instead
of
dropping
a
bomb.

You
heard
what
I
said
about
rising
above
and
proving
that
we
have
good
moral
values.
By
the
same
token,
if
there
is
any
information
that
we
can
get,
and
I'm
saying
this

When
were
you
becoming
a
SEAL,
did
you
get
waterboarded?
When
I
went
through
SEAL
school,
we
had
a
different
type
of
torture
called
the
smoke
torture.
So
I
got
smoke
tortured,
which
is
still
a
way
of
making
you
think
that
you
are
choking
to
death.
I
didn't
have
that,
but
some
of
my
friends
when
I
went
through
SEAL
school,
select
individual,
a
lucky
few
actually
had
the
waterboarding
treatment.
But
I
also
want
to
say
that
this
is
the
new
face
of
fighting
this
enemy.
We
have
a
new
enemy.
We
have
a
new
war.
And
so
the
techniques
that
we
have
to
use
have
to
be
different.
We
have
to
focus
on
the
intelligence
community.
We
have
to

I

to

have

be
a
criminal

to

that's
something
else
I
want
to
look
at,
too,
because
we
get
into
real
troubled

we
capture
these
people
and

that
we
have
to

Which
leads
me
to
the
last
question
--
enhanced interrogation
or
torture,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
You
for
it
or
against
it?
Well,
I
don't
think
anyone
is
for
torture.
But
for
interrogation,
yes,
absolutely.
Well,
interrogation
--
we...
We
waterboarded
three
individuals.
One
of
those
individuals
was
KSM.
And
you
know,
there's
other
people
who
were
involved
in
that

I
wasn't
involved
in

who've
said

To

of

I
talk
to

there
is
a
lot
of
back
and

on
this
issue
about
the

the

came
from,
whether
it
came
from

the

that
we
are
dealing

Well,
I
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
question,
Bret.
It
seems
to
me
what
is
behind
all
this
is
the
idea
that
somehow
enhanced interrogation
waterboarding
is
now
legitimized
by
the
fact
it
may
have
contributed
to
capturing
and
killing
bin

I
don't

Those
are
two
different
issues.
You
can
say
they
were
effective
and
we
don't
believe
in
them,
but
you
amount
deny
they
were
effective.
I
don't
know
that
you
say
conclusively
they
were
effective.
I
think
we
used
them
and
in
some
cases
we
may
have
gotten
information
as
a
result
of
it.
That
doesn't
mean
that
we
couldn't
have
obtained
it
from
other
techniques,
which
is
what
I

from

of

let's
not

that
it's

at

tables.

have
been

about

all

and
we're
talking
about
what
they
are
talking
about.

I
think,
certainly,
we
underestimate,
Glenn,
the
dismay
with
the
United
States
around
the
world,
especially
in
the
Muslim
world.
We
heard
the

again
and
again
as
did
President
Bush,
as
did
President

that
we're

And
it's
a
very
broad
war
and
one
that
we're
going
to
have
to
fight
for
a
very
long
time.
It
doesn't
seem
to
me,
though,
that
--
I
mean,
you
know
and
I
know,
Michael,
we
can't
fight
this
war
for
a
very
long
time.
How
much
is
this
war
costing
us?
Look
at
our
debt.
What
is
happening
to
us
is
exactly
what
Osama
Bin

said
he
would
do
to
us,
I
And
that's
the
road
that
we're
heading
down.
If
we
don't
have
a
competing

one
that

that's
what

Well,
there
is

a

between

if

I
wanted
clarification
as
I
was
watching
the
debate
tonight.
The
question
came
up
two
years

and
the
issue
of
waterboarding.
You
were
against
it
two
years

I
wasn't
clear.
I
was
listening
carefully
to
the

that
Chris

I
don't

I
was
against
it.
I
said
you
have
to

you
look
at
all
we

black

all
these
methods
used,
the

policies

I

when
the
dust
settles
somebody
should
ask
the

the
record
is

think
they
did
lead
or
contribute
to

your

Let
me
go
an
issue
that
concerns
me,
and
it's
about
what
I
describe
as
the
hypersensitivity
of
the
White
House
as
it
relates
to
Islamic
extremists.
They
didn't
use
the
words
"war
on
terror"
for
a
long
time.
Mirandizing
enemy
combatants,
I
take
issue
with.
What
did
you
think
of
the
funeral
that
took
place?
We
are
told
that
bin
Laden
is
not
a
Muslim,
he
represents
a
perversion,
hijacking
of
Islam.
Yet
he
got
full
Islamic
custom,
40
minute
ceremony
on
a
warship.
He
was
even
--
interpreted
into
Arabic.
Isn't
he
one
of
the
radical
Islamists
you
were
talking
about
tonight
that
doesn't
represent
Islam?
All
of
this
foreign
policy
successes
of
this
president
had
been
a
continuation
of
the
strategic
decisions
the
Bush
administration
made
on
Gitmo,
Iran
--
excuse
me,
on
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
and
with
of
course
Usama
bin
Laden.
What
he
did
with
Usama
bin

All
of
the
intelligence
they
received
that
led
up
to
the
killing
of
Usama
bin

enhanced interrogation
techniques,
Gitmo,
rendition,
black
sites,
he
called
these
things
torture.
Eric

the

he

He
wasn't
going

He
would
not

about
it.
That
tells
you
this
president
doesn't
understand
what
it
takes
to
defend
America.
His
greatest
foreign
policy
success
was
because
of
a
president

understood
what
it
takes
to
fight
this
terroristic
threat,
and

What
do
you
think
of
--
the
president
was
down
at
Ground
Zero
today.
We
had
the
killing
of
bin
Laden.
Obviously,
rendition,
enhanced interrogation,
black
sites,
you
know,
ops,
covert
operations
helped.
The
president
has
yet
to
give
credit
to
George
W.
Bush,
those
were
his
policies.
These
are
the
very
policies
the
president
opposed.
Sunday
wouldn't
have
been
possible
but
for
those
policies.
And
whether
or
not
he'll
come
back
and
decide,
well,
he
didn't
have
exactly
the
right
idea
on
interrogation,
I
don't
know.
I
doubt
if
he'll
admit
he
made
a
mistake.
I
wonder
if
he's
still
--
still
want
to
close
Gitmo.
That
was
one
of
his
first
acts.
But
I
think
at
least
now
we're
all
focused
on
the
benefits
of
being
tough.
We
have
to
be
tough.
We've
got
a
deadly
enemy.
But
I'm
just
so
proud
of
the
folks
who
went
in
and
did
this.
And
I'm
going
to
give
the
administration
their
due
on
it.
The
pictures,
the
conflicting
narrative
out
there,
and
the
funeral
really,
really
got
to
me.
I
thought,
you
know,
the
idea
that
he's
not
a
Muslim
because
he's,
you
know,
perverted
and
hijacked
a
religion.
And
then
they
go
through
this
ritual,
thinking
--

No.
But
I
thought
--
I
said
to
you
earlier
when
we
were
talking
about
this,
the
distinction
was
made,
it
was
not
in
reference
for
Osama
bin
Laden,
it
was
for
Islam.
But
I
thought
he's
not
--
But
he
hijacked
the
religion.
Correct.
But
we
don't
want
anybody
who's
Muslim
to
mistake
that
we
understand
their
faith
and
we
will
honor
their
faith.
It
is
not
to
honor
him.
It
may
turn
out
to
be
true.
Well,
I
don't
--
I
don't
know
that.
And
I
think,
look,
in
terms
of
the
funeral,
those
kinds
of
things,
I
think
Juan
has
it
exactly
right.
This
was
--
we
don't
want
anybody
to
misinterpret
that
we
do
not
honor
religion,
all
reli
Wait
a
minute.
But
he's
not
--
He's
not
--
we're
told
that
he
is
not
Muslim,
in
the
sense
--
A
peaceful
religion,
hijacked
by
radicals
like
him.
Why
give
him
the
consideration?
Why?
It
is
not
about
him.
It's
not
about
giving
him
consideration.
He's
the
one
that
got
the
40-minute
funeral.
It's
about
--
it's
the
same
thing
--
But
larger
controversy
continues
to
be
however,
coerced interrogation.
The
FACTOR
now
has
six
primary
sources,
six,
that
say
waterboarding
and
other
tough
methods
led
to
vital
information
that
eventually
brought
bin

down.
A
primary
source
is
someone
Well,
the
headline
is
CIA
interrogations
work.
I
mean
the
fact
is
in
the
period
after
9/11,
we
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
the
enemy
who
attacked
us.
We
did
not
know
that
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
was
the
mastermind
of
9/11.
We
didn't
know
who

key

And
then
we
started
capturing
these
terrorists
we
captured
Abu
Zubaydah,
who
was
the
key
al
Qaeda
facilitator.
And
he
gave
us
information
that
led
us
to
Ramzi
bin
al-Shibh,
who
was
one
of
key
KSM's
key
operatives.
And
they
together
led
us
to
KSM.
And
KSM

And
he
didn't
see
a
lawyer.
He
was
put
under
enhanced interrogation
techniques
and
he
went
--
once
he
went
--
once
he
went
through
those,
he
made
a
decision
to
cooperate
and
when
he
was
done,
he
was
running
a
graduate
level
class
on
al

operations

And
you
believe
that
he
--
he
was
broken
because
of
waterboarding.
He
was
waterboarded
many
times?
There
is
no
--
there
is
no
question.
Let's
zero
in
on
the
courier
who
was
the
key
to
finding
bin
Laden.
I
understand
that
the
--
that
KSM
and
another
guy
who
is
subjected
to
enhanced interrogation,
mentioned
--
Well,
I
mean,
they
--
we
had
very
little
information
about
al
Qaeda's
courier
networks.
What
happened
was
first
--
Abu
Zubaydah
and
Ramzi
bin
al-Shibh
who
were
the
first
guys
brought
into
the
program
gave
us
some
general
information
about
couriers,
about

When
KSM
was
interrogated
after
he
underwent
waterboarding
not
during
it
afterwards.
When
he
was
going
--
when
he
was
being
questioned,
he
acknowledged
that
he
--
they
had
given
us
the
name
of
this
fellow
al-Kuwadi
(ph)
which
was
a
nom
de
guerre
and
KSM
a
Then
in
2004
we
captured
a
fellow
named
Hasan
Ghoul
(ph)
who
was
a
--
who
was
a
senior
al
Qaeda
operative.
He
was
captured
in
Iraq.
And
he
told
us
that
--
that
this
courier
al-Kuwadi,
was
a
--
was
a
key
Lieutenant
of
KSM's
successor
Abu
Faraj
al-Libi
--
Now
did
he
do
that
under
duress
--
let
me
just
--
did
he
do
that
under
duress
or
did
he
just
tell
us.
All
right,
so
you
are
convinced
then,
that
that
information
provided
by
KSM
and
then,
the
other
guy
Ghoul
who
was
captured
a
couple
of
years
later.
Pinpointed
for
the
CIA
this
courier
and
then
they
started
to
tail
him
and
that
led
to
bin
Laden's
demise?
Is
that
correct?
Well,
actually,
yes,
well,
Abu
Faraj,
I'm
sorry
Hasan
Ghoul
told
us
that
he
was
a
key
operative
of
Abu
Faraj
al-Libi
who
was
KSM's
successor
after
he
was
captured.
So
they
capture
Abu
Faraj
in
2005
and
he's
brought
into
the
CIA
interrogation
program.
He's
not
waterboarded
but
he
--
but
he
undergoes
enhanced interrogation
and
was
resistant,
brought
into
a
state
of
cooperation.
And
then,
he
starts
giving

for
us?
All
right.
That
because
one,
we
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
--
the
black
sites
have
been
closed
by
Barack
Obama
and
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques
are
gone.
So
we
have
no
interrogation
plan.
Leon
Panetta
said
if
we
ever
capture
UBL
and
bring
him
to
Well,
I
have
no
problem
admitting
when
people
who
are
sources
and
eyewitnesses
that
I
am
not,
Bill,
saying
that
these
events
and
this
type
of
interrogation
led
to
the
capture
of
Usama
bin
Laden.
I
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
However,
I
do
believe,
based
on
information
that
I
have
found,
including
in
2003,
when
military
intelligence
was
sent
to
Iraq
that
they
found
nine
out
of
10
people
that
they
interrogated
gave
up
the
same
information
that
they
used
traditional
methods.
Or

So
you
know
what
the
"New
York
Times"
said
today.
You
know
what
Alan
Colmes
said
on
this
broadcast.
That
he
absolutely
simply
refused,
no
matter
how
overwhelming
the
evidence
to
cede
the
point
that
the
Bush
administration
policies
of
coerced,
enhanced
int
Yes
and
that
is
--
that
is
a
subject
that
can
be
debated
in
law
schools
around
the
country.
And
perhaps
the
Supreme
Court
someday
will
have
to
deal
with
that
and
that's
fine.
I
have
no
beef
with
that.
This
is
not,
this
is
a
war
on
terror
with
no
uniforms
and
no
rules.
Would
you
feel
uncomfortable
with
giving
the
President
of
the
United
States
the
power,
only
him,
to
order
coerced interrogations
supervised
by
the
White
House?
Would
you
feel
uncomfortable
with
that?
I
guess
I
would
feel
uncomfortable
if
I
was
advising
the
President
to
violate
the
law
but
I
would
also
site
Alan
Dershowitz,
a
great
liberal
professor
at
Harvard
who
wrote
a
book
about
torture
and
cited
the
example,
Leslie,
if
there
were
ticking
time
bomb
So
there
is
no
clear
answer
here
other
than
if
we
want
to
allow
this,
we
ought
to
make
it
lawful
and
not
put
CIA
agents
at
risk
with
an
ambiguous
situation.
They
ought
to
know
they
are
not
going
to
prosecute.
Well,
you
know,
I
think
that's
a
good
idea.
I
think
Congress
should
pass
a
law
that
says
precisely
that;
that
the
President
of
the
United
States
has
the
power
in
a
national
security
emergency
to
order
these
kinds
of
techniques
and
then
list
the
techniques
Would
you
oppose
that
Leslie?
Let
me
explain
that
so
people
know
the
reference
you're
making.
There's
still
an
active
investigation
by
a
special
prosecutor
into
the
CIA
agents
who
did
the
coerced interrogation.
That
is
insane.
--
he
may
be
back-channeling
it.
I
haven't
heard
a
word
about
it.
They
may
be
putting
it
in
the
back
drawer.
Well,
Bill,
Debra
Burlingame
today,
obviously
a
9/11
family
member
on
United
93.
She
actually
was,
you
know
had
a
chance
to
meet
with
the
President
briefly,
had
a
brief
encounter.
It
brought
up
the
issue
of
the
interrogations.
She
claims
that
the
Presiden
And
she,
and
a
lot
of
other
family
members,
are
livid
about
this.
Ideologues,
ideologues
--
the
left
is
crazed
about
the
issue.
You
watched
this
program
the
last
three
nights.
How
much
evidence
do
we
have
to
present?
All
right.
But
you
they
still
--
they
being
the
far
left
--
they
say
we
don't
care.
We
don't
care
how.
Oh,
no.
We
don't
want
to
know
--
we
don't
want
to
know
if
enhanced interrogation
actually
led
ultimately
to
the
death
of
bin
Laden.
No,
they
deny
it.
It's
not
that
they
want
to
know.
They
deny
it
no
matter
how
much
evidence
you
put
forth.
They
say
oh
it
didn't
happen.
Yes.
Even
if
their
own
people
say
that
it
actually
did.
But
in
the
end,
it's
about
what
are
we
doing
now?
Our
CIA
is
now
not
interrogating
anyone
Bill.
No
interrogations.
Are
we
safer
now?
And
Bill,
look,
again,
the
question
here
is,
what
are
we
doing
today
and
going
forward?
Whether
they
are
retaliatory
attacks
or
just
the
same
threat
we
had
before,
we
should
be
doing
everything
to
prevent
our
country
from
getting
attacked
again.
Shutting

Why
16
hours?
This
is
why
I
believe
the
poll
numbers
will
fall
apart
and
why
it
took
him
16
hours,
because
I
think
he
got
all
tripped
up
in
his
own
mind,
because
he
was
contradicting
every
bit
of
foreign
policy,
everything
--
everything
he's
ever
advocate
He's
against
waterboarding,
right?
Here
it
is.
I
believe
that
waterboarding
was
torture.
And
I
think
that
the
--
whatever
legal
rationales
were
used,
it
was
a
mistake.
It
was
mistake,
yet
it
was
the
waterboarding
of
the
hairy
back
guy
that
provided
intel
that
led
to
UBL's
doorstep.
So,
you
must
have
been
--
there's
probably
20
minutes
on
that
one.
Geez,
man,
was
I
wrong
on
this
one?
Now,
he's
also
been
calling
for
the
closing
down
of
Gitmo.
But
without
the
information
from
the
detainees,
we'd
be
nowhere.
He
wanted
all
the
al
Qaeda
leaders
tried
in
civilian
court.
His
administration
is
more
harshly
investigating
criminally
CIA
officers
who
interrogated
al
Qaeda
leaders
than
perhaps
the
al
Qaeda
leaders
themselves.
He
wants
them
tried
to
show
off
our
criminal
justice
system.
But
this
one,
he
says
go
in
and
kill
them
It
wasn't
long
ago
that
he
unnecessarily,
strangely,
stuck
his
neck
out
to
defend
a
questionable
Muslim
community
center
across
the
street
from
Ground
Zero.
Do
you
remember?
As
a
citizen
and
president,
I
believe
Muslims
have
the
right
to
practice
their
religion
as
everyone
else
in
this
country.
And
that
includes
--
--
that
includes
the
right
to
build
a
place
of
worship
and
a
community
center
on
private
property
in
Lower
Manhattan.
It's
bazaar.
The
Cordoba
House,
possibly,
with
terrorist
ties.
Cordoba,
by
the
way,
is
a
word
that
signifies
the
beginning
of
Islamic
rule
in
Spain.
Torture
does
not
end
up
yielding
good
information.
Those
statements
are
now
turning
out
to
be
false.
The
overwhelming
evidence
is
that
coerced interrogation
did
contribute
to
bin
Laden's
demise.
We'll
take
an
honest
look
at
the
situation
with
Donald
Rumsfeld
and
Juan
Williams.
Now,
it
is
extremely
frustrating
to
watch
pundits
and
politicians
put
ideology
above
the
safety
of
you,
the
American
people.
And
that's
what's
happening.
CIA
Chief
Leon
Panetta
an
honest
guy,
admitted
that
coerced interrogation
gave
the
U.S.
government
vi
UNIDENTIFIED
FEMALE:
Some
valuable
information
did,
in
fact,
come
from
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
Obviously
there
was
--
there
was
some
valuable
information
that
was
derived
through
those
kinds
of
interrogations
but
I
guess
the
question
that
everybody
will
always
debate
is
whether
or
not
those
approaches
had
to
be
used
in
order
to
get
the
same
informa
We
do
not
torture,
period.
The
reason
this
is
--
is
important
is
not
only
because
torture
does
not
end
up
yielding
good
information
and
most
intelligence
officers
agree
with
that.
I
do
not
think
the
United
States
government
sanctioning
torture
is
in
our
best
interest.
I
do
not
think
torture
works.
Can
you,
Mr.
Vice
president,
ever
envision
a
time
when
waterboarding
should
be
used
on
anyone?
No.
It's
not
effective.
Now
the
most
important
thing.
You
just
heard
Barack
Obama,
Secretary
of
State
Clinton
and
Vice
President
Biden
say
flat
out
that
coerced interrogation
doesn't
work.
We
now
know
that
is
false.
It
does
work.
Correct?
Ok.
That
being
said
then,
you
cited
two
names
and
the
CIA
and
yourself
as
primary
sources
that
coerced interrogation
provided
information
that
protected
American.
Correct?
Am
I
correct
on
that?
You
provided
the
sources
and
your
sourcing
is
correct.
No,
no.
But
they
didn't
repudiate
it.
They
should
have
come
out
and
said
I
was
wrong.
This
intel
--
instead
the
"Talking
Points"
from
Washington
it
was
a
mosaic
--
it
was
a
mosaic
of
information.
They
are
bending
over
like
pretzels
trying
to
get
away
from
And
if
some
of
that,
as
Director
Panetta
says,
came
from
the
enhanced interrogations,
the
waterboarding,
then
in
fact,
the
mosaic
would
not
have
produced
the
outcome
and
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
get
Osama
bin
Laden.
Maybe
not.
Although
in
fact
what
they've
done
is
they
reversed
themselves
on
most
of
the
things
they
attacked
during
the
campaign;
on
indefinite
detention,
Guantanamo
Bay,
military
commissions,
the
Patriot
Act,
all
of
these
things
they
campaigned
against

--
and
they
are
protecting
the
American
people.
All
right.
Fair
enough.
OK.
We
will
talk
about
that
in
a
second.
But,
here's
the
point.
They
say
he
is
not
Muslim.
And
then
they
go
through
this
45
minute
interpreted
into
Arabic
Islamic,
you
know,
funeral
that
this
guy
had.
No,
is
that
right?
It's
not.
All
right.
But
one
last
thing,
there
is
a
hypersensitivity.
Is
there
some
underlying
belief
system
in
the
president
that
somehow
he
can
still
convince
radical
Islamists
to
like
us?
But
he
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
Muslim.
He
is
not
understanding
Muslims
or
Arabs
at
all
here.
By
the
way,
I
mean
Bin
Laden
was
not
supposed
to
be
a
Muslim.
Sean,
Guantanamo
Bay,
indefinite
detention,
rendition
to
third
sites,
black
sites,
warrantless
wiretapping,
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
The
left
including
Barack
Obama
pounded
President
Bush
as
a
war
criminal.
Somebody
who
ravaged
the
constitution,
Very
well
said,
yes.
Oh,
he
does
want
Miranda
rights
to
enemy
combatants
on
the
battlefield.
But
he's
willing
to
kill
Bin
Laden
without
any
due
process
at
all.
Interesting.
We
always
had
the
means
to
take
out
Bin
Laden.
We
just
didn't
have
the
intelligence.
But,
because
of
enhanced interrogations,
even
Leon
Panetta
suggested
that
was
a
part
of
the
success.
Because
of
Gitmo,
rendition,
black
sites,
tough interrogations,
you
know,
the
very
things
he
was
referring
to
as
torture,
the
very
thing
that
investigating
for
possible
prosecution
of
CIA
operatives.
Without
these
things,
this
success
would
not
have
been
possible
on
Sunday.
So
the
question
is,
why
can't
the
president
graciously
go
out
there?
He
has
had
a
number
of
days
now
and
say
thank
you
to
President
Bush
for
his
part
in
creating
this
scenario
unde
There
are

heroes
who
today
get
dogged
by
some
of
these
unhinged
leftists
in
their

homes,
get
dogged
by
some
of
these
zealots,
still
trotting
around
in
their
Gitmo
orange
suits
and
as
I
-
Well,
let
me
just
-
there's
one
more
point
I
want
to
make
because
I
really,
definitely
want
to
throw
Jay
Carney's
words
right
back
at
him,
Sean.
He
said
there's
no
one
single
act
that
led
to
the
capture
and
killing
of
Bin
Laden.
That
is
certainly
true
and
I
think
in
addition
to
tipping
Obama's
hat
to
Bush
on
enhanced interrogations,
rendition

every
single

And
the
same
issue
with
not
releasing
the
pictures.
I
think
a
big
mistake,
but
I
want
to
ask
you
as
it
relates
to
the
funeral
on
U.S.
warship
on
an
aircraft
carrier.
Because,
you
know,
first
of
all
we're
told
Bin
Laden
is
not
a
Muslim.
That
he
has
basically
hijacked
a
religion,
perverted
a
religion,
which
I
agree
with.
Most
Muslims,
I
don't
think
agree
with
him,
but
we
do
have
radical
Islamists
and
we've
got
to
deal
with
them.
Why,
Steve,
there
was
no
way
this
would
have
happened,
but
for
the
policies
of
George
W.
Bush.
What
we
know
about
this
is
that
the
courier

of
interrogations,
black

Gitmo,
interrogations
and
enhanced interrogations

John
McCain
opposed
those
policies,
too.
John
McCain
also
opposed
those
policies.
This
day
wouldn't
have
happened,
but
for
President
Bush's
policies.
He
can't
credit
George
Bush
in
any
way?
Are
we
going
to
continue
rendition?
Are
we
going
to
go
back
to
enhanced interrogation
techniques?
That's
the
confusion,
it
worked.
Acknowledge
what
worked.
Acknowledge
that
you
have
made
mistakes
in
the
past
even
rhetorically
does
like
it.
Right
now,
the
American
people
are
rewarding
you
for
doing
the
right
thing.
Wait
a
minute.
This
is
the
same
White
House
that
wants
to
Mirandize
enemy
combatants
on
the
battlefield.
I
don't
believe
that
torture
made
us
safer.
It
wasn't
torture.
Why
did
we
have
a
Japanese
imprisoned?
So
basically,
this
is
a
step
by
step
process
whereby
you
need
to
build
a
case
gradually.
One
thing
President
Bush
did
that
President
Obama
did
not
is
take
a
lot
of
enemy
combatants.
That
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
do.

was

Are
they
right?
Well,
I
can
answer
it
this
way
--
as
the
national
security
advisor,
I'm
not
going
to
comment
on
specific
piece
of
intelligence
gotten
from
specific
sources.
But
I
can
tell
you
this,
and
it's
important
I
think
--
an

like
this
is
a
result
of

I
understand
that,
sir.
But
what
I'm
asking
you
is:
did
any
of
the
information,
any
of
the
fruits
of
enhanced interrogation
--
was
that
part
of
the
jigsaw
puzzle?
It
doesn't
really
work
that
way,
though,
right?
I
mean,
it
works
in
terms
of
a
whole
mosaic
of
information
being
put
together.
And
we
got
information
from

from

sources,

why
is
shooting
an
unarmed
man
in
the
face
legal
and
proper
while
enhanced interrogation,
including
waterboarding
of
a
detainee
under
very
strict
controls
and
limits,
why
is
that
ove
What
I
am
second
guessing
is,
if
that's
OK,
why
can't
you
do
waterboarding?
What
can't
you
do
enhanced interrogation
of
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
who
was
just
as
bad
an
operator
as
Osama
bin
Laden?
Because,
well,
our
judgment
is
that
it's
not
consistent
with
our
values,
not
consistent
and
not
necessary
in
terms
of
getting
the
kind
of
intelligence
that
we
need.
But
shooting
bin
Laden
in
the
head
is
consistent
with
our
values?
We
are
at
war
with
Osama
bin
Laden.
We're
at
war
with
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
But
why
is
it
inappropriate
to
get
information
from
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed?
I
didn't
say
it
was
inappropriate
to
get
information
from
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
You
said
it
was
against
our
values.
I
think
the
technique
--
there's
been
a
policy
debate
about
and
our
administration
has
made
our
views
known
on
that.
Let
me
ask
you
about
one
other
aspect
of
this
and
we'll
move
on.
The
Obama
Justice
Department
reopened
an
investigation
of
half
dozen
CIA
agents
who
were
involved
in
interrogation
after
9/11,
raising
the
question
--
and
this
has
been
a
closed.
This
has
be
Question:
with
interrogation
--
and
you
certainly
have
agreed,
whether,
however
it
came
--
with
interrogation
such
a
key
part
of
this
raid,
why
not
end
that
investigation?
Well,
what
I
said
was
the
interrogation
is
one
part
of
a
mosaic
--
But
why
not
end
the
investigation?
When
the
president
first
came
into
office,
he
moved
to
close
Guantanamo.
He
has
had
to
give
up
on
that
now.
He
also
suspended
the
enhanced interrogation
program
and
substituted
the
provisions
of
the
U.S.
Army
Manual
for
that
purpose.
So,
it's
not
clear
to
After
looking
at
all
the
information,
for
the
last
week,
since
the
takeout
of
bin
Laden,
and
I'm
sure
talking
to
some
of
your
friends
in
the
intelligence
community
--
how
big
a
role
did
enhanced interrogation
play
in
all
of
the
information
that
led
up
to

Well,
I
think
we'll
know
more
in
the
days
ahead,
and
a
whole
range
of
issues
with
respect
to
the
bin
Laden
operation.
But,
as
best
I
can
tell,
from
the
people
I
talked
with
and
worked
with,
that
when
we
talk
about
Jose
Rodriguez
who
ran
the
counter
--
the
--
the
counterterrorism
program,
Michael
Mukasey,
who
was
the
attorney
general,
we've
--
Leon
Panetta,
all
have
said
one
way
or
the
other
that
the
enhanced interrogation
program
played
a
role.
That
is
to
say
some
of
the
early
leads
came
out
of
that
progra
Which
raises
the
question,
if
we
were
to
now
capture
another
new
high-value
target,
which
is
certainly
more
likely,
given
this
apparent
trove
of
information
that
they
recovered
in
bin
Laden's
compound
--
should
the
president
reinstate
enhanced interrogati
Now,
you
say
it's
not
torture.
Even
waterboarding?
Because
Leon
Panetta
has
said
waterboarding
is
torture.
So,
you
would
put
it
back
on
the
table
if
you
were
the
president
and
they
got
another
new
high-value
target?
If
it
were
my
call,
I'd
have
the
program
ready
to
go
on
the
chance
that
any
day
you
may
capture
a
detainee
who
has
vital
piece
of
information
about
the
next
attack
or
about
some
new
developments,
and
I
think
the
program
provides
us
with
the
capacity
to
co
As
you
know,
the
Obama
Justice
Department
reopened
an
investigation
of
half
dozen
CIA
officers
for
whether
or
not
they
used
undue
force
in
interrogation
after
9/11.
This
is
an
investigation
that
had
been
closed
in
2007
during
the
Bush
administration.
Now,
I'm
saying
it
is
an
outrage
that
we
would
go
after
the
people
who
deserve
the
credit
for
keeping
us
safe
for
7
1/2
years.
And
that
these
men
--
all
devoted,
capable
officials
--
shouldn't
have
to
look
over
their
shoulder
and
worry
that
if
they
follow
the

Really,
I
didn't
know
that.
All
right.
Let's
go
to,
you
know,
the
media
this
week
did
not
focus
at
all
--
the
only
reason
we
were
able
to
kill
Bin
Laden
on
Sunday
is
because
let's
see,
Gitmo,
enhanced interrogation,
rendition,
black
sites,
all
of
these

Sean,
what
Barbara
Walters
just
said.
But
it
was
Obama
who
had
the
courage
and
the
guts
and
the
coolness.
George
Bush
didn't
have
courage,
and
guts
and
coolness?
And
even
Bill
Clinton,
he
didn't
have
courage
and
guts?
Only
Usama

Santorum
sparred
with
libertarian-leaning
Congressman
Ron
Paul
of
Texas
who
opposes
waterboarding
terror
detainees
for
intelligence.
OK.
That's
just
simply
not
true,
Ron.
I
mean,
the
fact
is
that
we
found
that
some
of
these,
some
of
this
information
that
we
find
out
that
led
to
Osama
bin
Laden
actually
from
these
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
Several
security
incidents
over
the
weekend
put
Americans
on
alert
as
the
death
of
bin
Laden
continues
to
raise
questions
about
a
possible
retaliatory
strike.
Will
the
treasure
trove
of
information
seized
in
the
bin
Laden
raid
finally
bring
down
Al-Qaeda?
I
thought
Chris
Wallace
had
an
excellent
question
this
weekend
on
FOX
News
Sunday.
And
he
was
talking
to
the
White
House
National
Security
adviser.
And
he
said,
why
is
it
contrary
to
American
values
to,
you
know,
use
enhanced interrogation
techniques
agai
You
got
to
rid
of
Miranda
rights.
You
can't
waterboard
him.
I
think
that
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
remember
what
the
former
Attorney
General
McCaskill
said,
which
is
the
Bush's
attorney
general.
Which
is
that,
the
two
leads
that
really
lead
to
the
bi
Well,
that's
the
interesting
thing.
And
especially
as
the
president
goes
on
his
I
killed
Usama
victory
tour.
Which
I
don't
have
any
problem
with
spiking
the
football,
to
use
his
terms.
You
know,
as
this
happens,
this
is
what
has
now
emerged
and
it's
also

So,
if
we
want
more
successful
days
like
this,
we
must
argue
that
the
Obama
policies
were
wrong
and
the
Bush
policies
were
right,
this
is
the
first
time
that
Bush
hasn't
gotten
any
credit.
And
of
course,
the
Bush
interrogation
techniques
led
to
bin
Laden's
capture.
It
was
said
about
this.
Remember,
this
administration
called
it
torture,
even
after
an
investigation,
even
after
the
CIA
inspector
general
report,
everything
came
out
and
said
that
the
interrogators
did
their
job,
did
it
properly,
case
was
closed.
But
remember,
the
administration,
the
president
referring
to
all
this
as
torture.
Eric
Holder
found
what
they
did
to
get
--
and
extract
the
information
disgusting.
Now,
we
have
six
CIA
interrogators
that
maybe
prosecuted.
Facing
an
indictment.
And
facing
indictment.
Yes,
right.
For
the
very
interrogation
that
gave
us
this
information.
It
is
just
revolting.
But
it
is
also
very,
very
dangerous.
And
let's
just
understand
there
are
two
issues
here
at
stake.
One
is
the
question
of
how
do
you
interrogate
someone,
waterboarding
and
that
stuff?
The
other
is
the
concept
that
you
can
interrogate
All
right.
On
the
next
segment,
what
I
mentioned
with
Dick
Morris,
so
we
are
going
to
play
this
tape
of
FOX
News'
Sunday
host
Chris
Wallace.
I
thought
he
asked
a
really
good
question
of
the
White
House
National
Security
adviser,
about,
you
know,
enhanced

Do
you
believe
what
happened
in
the
killing
of
bin
Laden
vindicates
--
your
father
was
a
fierce,
strong
advocate
is
to
this
day
of
enhanced interrogations,
black
sites,
rendition
policies,
all
of
the
things
that
President
Obama
cancelled
--
go
ahead.
I
think
that
it
certainly
shows
that
those
programs
worked.
I
think
it
is
one
more
piece
of
evidence.
We
knew
that
those
programs
were
effective
before.
We
now
know
that
they
helped
lead
us
to
the
information
that
ultimately
led
to
bin
Laden.
And
I
think

By
the
way,
I
think
your
dad
was
right.
And
we'll
get
into
this
a
little
bit
more
as
we
move
forward,
is
that
the
CIA
interrogators
that
are
under
investigation
after
they
had
been
cleared
in
the
Bush
years,
I
think
they
ought
to
be
decorated
and
not
face
Absolutely.
And
don't
forget,
the
president
of
the
United
States
could
stop
it
himself,
it's
not
just
Eric
Holder.
The
president
is
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer.
He
ought
to
stand
up
tomorrow
and
say,
these
brave
men
helped
lead
us
to
bin
Laden.
They
Now,
some
on
the
left
are
still
refusing
to
admit
that
enhanced interrogation
tactics
played
a
central
role
in
capturing
the
world
most
notorious
terrorist.
Even
though
CIA
director
Leon
Panetta
has
already
confirmed
that

Why
is
shooting
an
unarmed
man
in
the
face,
legal
and
proper,
while
enhanced interrogation,
including
waterboarding
of
a
detainee
under
very
strict,
controls
and
limits,
why
is
that
over
the
line?
Why
can't
you
do
enhanced interrogation
of
Khalid
Sheikh
M
Yes,
because,
well,
our
judgment
is
that
it
is
not
consistent
with
our
values.
But
shooting
bin
Laden
in
the
head
is
consistent
with
our
values?
We
are
at
war
with
Usama
bin
Laden.
We
are
at
war
with
Khalid
Sheik
Mohammed.
Why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
get
information
from
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed?
I
didn't
say
it
was
inappropriate
to
get
information...
You
said
against
our
values.
I
think
that
the
techniques
are
something
--
there's
been
a
policy
debate
about
and
our
administration
has
made
our
views
known
on
that
And
just
a
short
time
ago
in
Paris,
US
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
reaffirmed
the
administration's
commitment
to
closing
Gitmo.
Despite
the
critical
role
that
the
facility
played
in
getting
bin
Laden.
Well,
and
it
is
actually
what
he
said.
We
are
at
war
with
him.
We
are
at
war
with
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
No,
but
we
are
at
war,
we
have
authorization
from
Congress
to
basically
go
after
the
people
who
were
responsible
for
9/11.
And
this
was,
you
know,
he
was
the
head
of
Al-Qaeda.
They
went
after
the
head
of
Al-
Qaeda.
And
I
think
they
killed
him.
It
would
be
Wait
a
minute
--
this
is
war.
Kimberly,
this
is
what
the
left
is
saying
here.
They've
been
trying
to
thread
this
needle.
Because
they
want
this
in
the
court
system.
You
know,
the
same
administration
wants
Miranda
rights
for
enemy
combatants
on
the
battlefield.
What
he
said
was
that
it
was
Intel
that
came
from
the
interrogation
of
the
detainees.
He
did
not
say
that
it
came
from
waterboarding.
And
in
fact,
based
on
what
we
know
which
granted
has
been,
there's
been
a
lot
of
different
information,
it
did
not
come
f
No,
no,
no,
that's
not
true,
no,
no,
no,
the
rendition.
Let
me,
first
of
all,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
opened
the
door
to
this
courier
first.
Well,
we
don't
know,
we
got
it
out
of
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
one
of
three
people
waterboarded.
Hang
on,
let
me
finish.
Then
the
courier,
you
know,
we
got
information
from
a
Libyan
others
using
black
rendition
sites
where
CIA
interrogators
got
information
there.
All
right.
Let's
me
say
different
things
here.
First
of
all,
just
because,
let's
just
say,
they
got
it
from
waterboarding
which
they
didn't.
But
I'm
just
going
to
say
that
they
did.
That
would
not
prove
that
the
only
way
to
get
it
is
from
waterboarding.
How
do
you
justify
putting
a
bullet
in
somebody's
brain
is
OK.
Morally
justified
but
waterboarding
or
interrogation
is
contrary
to
our
values.
No,
no
focus
on
that
question.
I
am,
we
live
on
a
continuum
here,
when
we
make
distinctions
between
self-defense.
You
know,
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
locking
someone
in
your
trunk
and
suffocating
them
to
death
and
self-
defense?
Yes.
I'm
making
a
moral
distinction.
You
put
a
bullet
in
one
guy's
head
and
that
morally
OK.
You
interrogate
people,
you
sleep
deprive
them,
you
waterboard
them,
only
three
people,
you
get
information
that
leads
to
bin
Laden.
Would
you
say
that
Bush
was
right
and
Obama
was
wrong?
No,
there's
a
direct
link
--
yes,
there
is
between
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques
that
were
used
if
by
the
CIA,
yes,
by
the
CIA
and
what
happened
with
bin
Laden.
But
what
we
know
is
under
the
enhanced interrogation,
they
gave
out
bad
information.
They
actually
didn't
answer
the
questions.
No,
but
believe
it,
but
that
help
reinforce,
they
thought
by
the
way
that
they
answered,
as
they
put
these
pieces
together.
And
this
is
where
intelligence
community
deserves
all
the
credit.
The
original
threat
began
with
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
Then
it
wa
It
was
years
after
the
waterboarding
that
he
gave
up
that
information.
No,
no,
no,
with
years
after
the
waterboarding
in
interrogations
that
we're
not
unnecessarily
enhanced interrogation.
One
at
a
time.
Would
bin
Laden
be
alive
today,
but
for
these
techniques?
I
argue
yes,
he
would
be
alive
today.
I'm
glad
that
the
president
made
the
decision
and
I'm
glad
that
Bush
put
in
place
the
policy
to
get
us
the
intelligence.
And
yes,
the
interrogation
program
and
yes,
he
would
be
alive
and
at
large.
Give
credit
to
the
Obama
administration.
Give
credit
to
the
Bush
administration.
Please,
restart
the
CIA
interrogation
program
that
is
very
valuable.
Nothing
is
wrong
with
interrogating
people.
The
idea
that
because
you
think
that
waterboarding
lead
to
this,
which
it
didn't,
that
may
be
the
only
way
you
can
get
it
is
wrong.
Chris
Wallace,
great
question.
We
can
put
a
bullet
in
bin
Laden's
brain,
but
we
can't
use
enhanced interrogations
against
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed?
Are
we
getting
into
a
debate
about
interrogation?
This
is
a
tough
one.
I
want
to
learn
more
about,
you
know,
what
the
actual
intelligence
has
enabled
us
to
get
the
courier
that
enabled
us
to
get
bin
Laden.
What
area
it
came
from.
I'm
leaning
towards
I
think
it
came
during
the
KSM
interrogations.
I
think
between
that
and
this
guy
in
a
rendition
black
site.
Let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
that
is
all
true.
I
have
every
confidence
now.
I
think
it's
pretty
clear
Panetta
indicated
it
was
pretty
true.
Isn't
that
the
right
thing
to
do?
Well,
in
terms
of
our
moral
standing
though
in
the
world
and
what
we
say
we
stand
for.
So
we
can
put
a
bullet
in
bin
Laden's
brain,
but
we
can't
waterboard
somebody?
I
don't
know
I
think
waterboarding
is
technically
that
bad
although
this
is
--
It's
very
-
but
I
don't
think
that
it's
--
some
of
the
other
techniques
are
far
worse
than.
It
is
--
first
of
all,
it
is
a
ridiculous
argument.
The
Republicans
ought
to
stop
whining.
The
reason
you
are
bringing
up
this
waterboarding
thing
because
Obama
scored
a
big
hit
here.
Listen
to
me
for
a
second.
It
is
immoral.
It
is
wrong
and
it
doesn't
work.
That's
the
other
side
of
it.
The
chief
CIA
interrogator
went
down
to
Guantanamo
and
his
report
back
was
enhanced interrogation
techniques
do
not
work.
There
is
no
evidence
that
this
thing
came
from
anybody
who
was
waterboarded.
I
don't
have
a
hard
time
with
sleep
deprivation,
but
waterboarding
is
a
different
story.
That
is
torture.
It
is
against
everything
we
stand
for.
That
may
not
be
for
what
Vince
stands
for
over
here
because
he
stays
in
character
all
the
time.
I'm
not
taking
anything
from
him.
Whatever
works,
I
don't
give
a
damn.
Whatever
works.
It
is
intimidation.
I'm
going
to
tell
you
something,
there
was
a
little
village
and
my
grandson
and
wife
was
there
and
everyone
else.
But
incorrect
information
also
is
also
elicited
through
torture
such
as
you
know,
the
weapons
of
mass
destruction
claim
that
was
used
in
Colin
Powell
speech
so
I
think
that
it
is
obviously
a
very
slippery,
slippery
slope.
What's
the
difference
with
him
and
KSM?
Through
interrogation,
you
often
times
get
better
information
through
softer,
more
subtle
--
What
are
you
suggesting?
They
should
have
given
him
his
Miranda
rights?
We
knew
KSM
was
the
mastermind
of
9/11,
stick
his
head
in
water
and
keep
it
down
there.
We
have
so
elicited
the
information.
I
don't
know
that
sticking
his
head
in
the
water
is
necessarily
--
Apparently
Leon
Panetta
and
three
former
CIA
directors
have
said
we
got
more
intelligence
from
enhanced interrogations
than
all
our
intelligence
agencies
--
I
see.
So
we
lose
our
moral
standing.
We
break
the
law
and
it
is
fine
--
we
are
going
to
be
just
like
the
"camel
jockeys"
right?
I
always
wanted
to
be
a
mob
guy
and
pretend
a
mob
guy
like
you
do
--
"Impact
Segment"
tonight,
as
you
may
know
the
Obama
administration
is
investigating
some
CIA
agents
who
may
have
participated
in
coerced interrogations.
That
is
an
extremely
controversial
act
as
the
men
were
cleared
by
the
Justice
Department
under
Preside
So
Juan,
I'm
on
record
as
saying
there
is
no
way
--
no
way
--
President
Obama
they
could
bring
charges
against
the
CIA
guys.
The
nation
wouldn't
stand
for
it.
What
say
you?
That's
right.
It's
politically
absurd
at
this
point,
untenable
and
I
think
it
would
absolutely
tear
the
country
apart,
Bill.
So,
I
don't
think
it's
going
to
happen.
But
that's
not
to
say
that
we
shouldn't
let
the
wheels
of
justice
grind
forward,
equal
justice
for
all.
But
ultimately
President
Obama
will
now
allow
any
kind
of
prosecution
to
go
forward.
Well,
that's
the
thing,
you
don't
get
anything
out
of
it.
I
think
it
sets
a
terrible
precedent
for
folks
who
are
putting
their
necks
out
there
who
are
trying
to
find
this
information,
who
were
cleared
in
the
past
and
now
are
having
to
deal
with
this.
The
question
is
it
looks
like
a
lot
like
a
posture.
And,
you
know,
President
Obama
is
very
good
at
telling
us
about
what
kind
of
country
we
are
and
what
kind
of
country
we
are
not.
But
it
gets
a
little
confusing
when
we
are
the
country
that
shot
win
Laden
I
mean
it
begins
to
look
very
much
like
a
political
game
and
these
guys
worked
very
hard.
Put
their
necks
out
there
to
keep
us
safe
from
other
folks.
And
now,
they
have
this
hanging
over
their
head.
I
just
don't
think
it's
tenable.
Last
week
on
this
broadcast,
we
were
talking
about
coerced interrogation.
And
then
you
brought
up
the
gouging
of
the
eyes
and
the
cutting
out
of
the
tongue
or
whatever
your
imagination
had
conjured
up
for
you.
And
I
scolded
you.
I
said
there
is
no
compari
Because
you
know
what?
Torture
is
torture.
There
is
nobody
who's
--
No
it's
not.
Nobody
who
has
gone
through
waterboarding
who
hasn't
said
it's
torturous.
And
you
know
what?
To
me
--
Ok.
Let
me
correct
you.
You
just
made
another
mistake.
Navy
Seals
and
Special
Forces
are
waterboarded
in
their
training.
I'm
sure
you
know
that
ok?
They
don't
say
it's
torture.
They
don't
say.
Yes,
they
do.
Primarily
because
their
mouths
are
full
of
water
--
they
don't
say
anything.
They're
being
trained.
They're
being
trained.
Bill,
that's
like
you
and
me.
If
two
people
knowing
each
other
for
such
a
long
time;
if
you
were
doing
something
to
me,
I'm
trusting
you,
that's
different
than
knowing
that
your
enemy
is
waterboarding
you.
Look,
Juan.
I
don't
object
to
you
--
I
don't
object
to
you
saying
that
in
your
opinion
waterboarding
is
torture.
That's
your
opinion
and
it's
valid.
What
I
do
object
to
you
is
saying
it's
akin
to
gouging
somebody's
eye
out
or
cutting
their
ear
off.
Ok.
But
I'm
telling
you.
Listen,
as
a
matter
--
and
this
is
where
Mary
Katharine
talked
about
values
and
getting
confused.
I
don't
have
any
confusion
about
saying
this
we
don't
torture
people.
That's
not
in
keeping
who
we
are
as
Americans.
And
that
inform
All
right.
Juan,
if
your
children
were
about
be
to
executed
by
the
Taliban
and
they
had
a
Taliban
guy
in
custody
who
might
know
where
they
are.
Juan,
you
would
be
gouging
their
eye
out
or
whatever
else,
you
know
it.
But
that's
how
you
have
to
evaluate
it,
Juan.
You
have
to
do
whatever
--
Yes.
You
are
right.
Basis
--
you
have
to
deal
with
that.
And
if
I
was
face
to
face
with
bin
Laden
thinking
he's
going
to
push
a
bomb
and
blow
up
the
whole
house
I
would
shut
him
in
the
head,
too.
And
you
wouldn't
--
That's
right.
You'd
shoot
him
in
the
head
--
if
you
were
ordered
to
shoot
him
in
the
head
and
you
were
a
SEAL
you'd
shoot
them
in
the
head.
That's
what
I
just
told
you.
All
right
Mary
Katharine.
I
want
to
give
you
the
last
word.
If
you
want
to
make
fun
of
Juan,
you
go
right
ahead.
Well,
first
of
all,
journalists
and
activists
have
subjected
themselves
to
waterboarding.
So
I
think
there
is
a
difference
between
that
and
gouging
eyeballs
out.
It's
a
discussion
that's
worthy
to
be
had
and
in
Juan's
opinion
is
valid.
But
there
is
a
diff
Interrogation,
the
counter
terror
policies
after
9/11
specifically
waterboarding.
General
Hayden,
isn't
it
something
of
an
open
question
as
to
whether
you
can
tie
that
moment
to
this
moment?
It's
fair
to
look
at
for
example,
again,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
but
he
actually
lied
about
the
courier
after
he
was
waterboarded
and
then
months
later
other
information
came
out.
So
this
is
just
a
model
--
No,
not
at
all.
Look,
eye
gouging
leaves
the
prisoner
with
no
eyeballs.
Waterboarding
leaves
him
out
of
breath
and
only
for
a
short
while.
But,
it's
not
equivalent
to
waterboarding.
I
mean,
waterboarding
gasping
for
air,
you
know?
Fish
bowl,
right.
You
say
you
know
what?
I
change
my
mind
on
coerced interrogation.
I
think
that
now
the
evidence
says
that
it
did
leave
to
capturing
bin
Laden,
at
least
in
part.
How
would
that
be
greeted,
Bernie,
if
you
uttered
that
opinion
at
CBS
News?
I
mean,
they
would
look
at
me
and
they
would
say
wait
a
second.
Are
you
saying
that
waterboarding
is
OK
under
certain
circumstances
and
if
I
said
yes,
I
would
be
marked.
I
would
be
marked
from
there
on
out.
Liberal
journalists
find
it
difficult.
I'm
almost
tempted
to
say
understandably
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
something
that
they
find
reprehensible
waterboarding,
that
they
find
not
only
wrong,
but
morally
wrong
could
lead
to
something
good
the
takedown

But,
to
some
extent,
bear
with
me,
so
some
extent,
it
is
muddled,
to
some
extent
it
is
that
in
this
respect.
I
don't
know
if
waterboarding,
even
though
a
lot
of
U.S.
officials
have
said
it
contributed
to
finding
the
courier
that
led
to
Usama
bin
Laden,
I

They
are
liberals
and
liberals
don't
like
to
make
the
connection
between
something
that
they
consider
torture
and
something
good
like
the
takedown
of
Obama.
But,
if
you
ask
me
tomorrow,
or
the
day
after
tomorrow
or
next
week,
I
don't
know
what
I
would
say
OK,
but
they
really
don't.
We
reported
last
week
with
Marc
Thiessen
who
I
think
is
the
best
source
on
the
coerced interrogation
and
if
people
want
to
see
that
interview,
I'm
going
to
have
it
posted
on
the
foxnation.com.
Right,
a
couple
of
points.
One,
I
believe
what
you
just
said
is
true.
I
believe
that.
But,
a
lot
of
this
--
the
high
ranking
U.S.
officials
who
say
it's
true
worked
in
the
Bush
administration
and
as
a
journalist
--
Not
Panetta,
absolutely
true.
Not
Panetta,
but
if
you
want
me
to
go
down
the
list
of
the
others.
Almost
all
of
the
others
worked
in
the
Bush
administration.
That
doesn't
mean
they
are
telling
the
truth,
but
they
may
have
a
dog
in
the
fight.
That's
all
I'm
Now
on
your
other
point,
journalists
will
run
away
from
this
connection
because
as
I
say,
they
don't
like
the
fact
that
something
that
they
find
wrong
led
to
something
good.
I'm
going
to
go
deep
into
fantasy
land
right
now.
We
don't
know
exactly
what
led
to
getting
bin
Laden.
We
don't
know
if
enhanced
torture
did
it.
Diane
Feinstein
said,
no
she's
at
the
intelligence
committee
in
the
senate.
Jeff
Brennan
counter
terrorism
official
for
George
W.
Bush
--
for
Barack
Obama
said

Panetta
did
not
say
that
interrogation
is
part
led
to
getting
bin
Laden.
He
said
it
happened
but
he
didn't
link
it
to
getting
bin
Laden.
You
know
what
I'm
more
comfortable
talking
about?
Waterboarding.
Excuse
me
--
the
daisy
chain
of
evidence
with
enhanced interrogation
techniques,
right.
...
Memphis,
Tennessee.
Two
Muslim
scholars
get
on
the
plane.
All
right?
These
are
legitimate
people.
And
there
they
are.
And
then
the
pilot
says,
"You
know
what?
I'm
not
taking
these
guys
anywhere."
Correct?
That's
absolutely
correct.
It's
unfortunate
timing,
because
guess
what?
They
were
on
their
way
to
speak
at
a
conference
about
this
very
issue
about
people
having
Islamophobia,
unreasonable
fears,
so
that's
just
perfect.
They
show
up
nine
hours
late
to
the
Do
we
know
if
they're
American
citizens?
I
don't
know
if
they're
American
citizens
or
not.
We
don't
know.
Again,
we
should
know
that.
Does
a
pilot
have
the
right,
Wiehl...
...
to
take
anyone
he
wants
off
the
plane
and
say,
"I
don't
want
to
fly
them"?
Yes.
For
cause.
There
has
to
be
some
kind
of
cause.
But
there
wasn't
in
this
case.
They
were
just
Muslims.
Just
the
way
they
were
dressed,
yes.
Let
me
just
continue,
too.
What
happens
is
the
plane
then
went
back.
They
were
--
went
through
security
again.
So
security
cleared
them
twice.
And
the
pilot
still
would
not
let
them
on.
So
the
pilot
is
in
trouble.
The
pilot
is
in
trouble.
The
pilot
saying,
"I
don't
trust
security.
We've
got
a
bigger
issue
here.
Well,
it
looks
like
it
was
a
Muslim
issue,
and
you
really
can't
do
that.
Even
though
TSA
cleared
them.
The
pilot
made
a
decision.
It
was
wrong.
There's
going
to
be,
probably,
a
civil
rights
investigation
by
the
Holder
administration.
These
guys
are
humiliated
and,
I
mean,
they're
legitimate
people,
and
you
just
can't
do
that.
Big
public
apology
about
this.
Without
the
policies
that
President
Bush
put
in
place,
Usama
bin
Laden
probably
would
not
be
dead
at
this
moment.
The
information
came
from
the
enhance interrogation
techniques,
it
came
from
Gitmo.
That
had
something
to
do
with
it.
It
came
from
a
hard
app
No,
remember
that
Congress
then
put
into
law
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques
into
its
statute.
The
next
month
when
President
Obama
was
inaugurated,
he
signed
an
executive
order
saying,
well,
that
might
true
but
I'm
personally
not
going
to
use
them.

He
can't.
All
right.
Well,
look,
I
guess
it's
even
more
troublesome
to
me
because
they
call
it
torture.
And
now,
we
are
investigating
the
very
interrogators
that
got
the
intelligence
that
led
to
the
killing
of
bin
Laden.
These
guys
are
still
on
the
hook.

They
should
be
honored,
they
should
be
decorated
for
doing
what
they
did
in
the
defense
of
their
country.
Without
them,
we
would
not
be
in
the
situation
that
we
are
in
today.
They
should
have
this
investigation
removed
immediately,
immediately.
The
--
you
asked
those
interrogators
to
do
very
tough
things,
tough,
legal,
and
safe,
and
effective.
If
President
Obama's
team
really
wanted
to
see
their
National
Security
poll
numbers
go
up,
they
would
dismiss
those
lawsuits.
Guys,
let's
turn
our
talk
about
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques
that
were
used
on
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
that
ultimately
led
to
the
capture
and
kill
of
Osama
bin
Laden.
Dr.
Jasser,
why
not
use
all
forms
of
interrogation
if
it
leads
to
the
capture
of
Well,
I
think
that's
a
great
question.
In
this
democracy
and
transparency
we
talk
about
these
things,
and
I
think
we
need
to
look
at
what
we
got
as
a
result
of
waterboarding
and
the
fact
that
we
can't
be
sanctimonious
and
say
that
we
will
not
use
any
form
Now,
Mr.
Rehab,
Chris
Wallace
on
Fox
News
Sunday
had
a
great
question.
He
asked
Mr.
Donilon
if
we're
--
if
it's
OK
to
shoot
someone
in
the
eye
and
kill
him
--
an
unarmed
man
--
why
is
it
not
OK
to
water
board
him?
Where
is

on
waterboarding
and
th
--
based
on
false
information
obtained
through
torture.
Before
I
lose
the
segment
here,
Dr.
Jasser,
the
head
of
the
CIA,
Leon
Panetta,
point
blank
said
waterboarding
was
one
of
the
techniques
used
and
it
aided
in
the
capture
of
bin
Laden.
Any
questions?
No,
I
mean,
I
think
ultimately
we
have
to
realize
that
the
Judeo
Christian
and
in
Islam
we
believe
that
there
is
just
war
and
unless
you're
a
pacifist,
you
have
to
believe
that
ultimately
targeting
individuals
morality
is
going
to
win
over
evil
by
the
use
As
Jews,
Christians
and
Muslims
we
also
believe
in
the
honorable
fight.
We
also
believe
in
fighting
in
a
way
that
--
And
as
far
as
the
enhanced interrogation
goes,
I'm
not
even
sure
that
Barack
Obama
won't
come
around
on
this.
Because
I
don't
know
if
anybody
else
has
noticed,
but
this
might
be
the
next
thing
to

by
the

program.

But
why
is
it
inappropriate
to
get
information
from
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed?
I
didn't
say
it
was
inappropriate
to
get
information
from
Sheikh
Mohammed.
You
say
it
was
against
our
values.
I
think
the
techniques
are
something.
There's
been
a
policy
debate
about
and
our
administration
has
made
our
views
known
on
that.
In
2009,
the
Obama
administration
officially
scrapped
the
CIA
program
which
had
included
the
waterboarding
of
three
detainees,
including
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
and
replaced
it
with
a
HIG,
or
High
Value
Interrogation
Group
that
is
headquartered
at
the
FBI.
These
men
deserve
to
be
decorated.
They
don't
deserve
to
be
prosecuted.
And
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
was
a
complete
investigation
done.
It
was
done
by
a
career
attorney
in
the
Justice
Department,
concluded
that
nobody
had
violated
the
law.
And
the

Honest
men
can
differ
as
to
whether
or
not
they're
comfortable
with
some
of
the
techniques
that
we
used
and
that's
a
fair
debate.
But
you
don't
get
to
say
that
the
techniques
didn't
work.
You
don't
get
to
say
that
the
program
wasn't
valuable.
Those
on
the
other
side
of
the
debate
say
the
investigation
by
a
career
prosecutor
at
Eric
Holder's
Justice
Department
should
be
more
wide
ranging.
Adding
--
It's
not
a
helpful
thing
to
accuse
people
who
did
these
kinds
of
things
under
clear
policy
guidance
in
the
past
that
they
were
doing
something
wrong
or
illegal.

I
think
politically
it's
somewhat
problematic
for
them.
But
at
the
same
time,
I
never
thought
the
investigation
was
intended
to
convict
anybody
or
prosecute
anybody.
It's
just
to
let
everyone
know
if
you
get
in
interrogation
business.
It
will
ruin
the
car
What
is
to
chill?
They
ended
the
enhanced interrogation
and
it's
all
under
the
army
field
manual.
It's
still
a
minor
thing,
a
preliminary
investigation,
so
Holder
can
say
to
mainstream
audiences
we're
just
doing
fact-finding
and
not
prosecuting
the
guys.
It's
a
very
cynical
move,
and
I
think
it's
outrageous.
One
thing
that
doesn't
change

is

One
thing
I
disagree
with
the
left
and
right
about,
whether
these

led
to

or
not

change
the
basic
argument.

is

would

to

you
describe
it.

agree
with

is
politically
untenable.

will

don't

Look,
I
think
it's
telling
that
both
of
the
fellows
agree
this
is
politically
untenable,
because
it
sure
is.
And
I
think
Eric
Holder
is
a
political
liability
for
the
administration.
It
is
an
outrage
that
we
would
go
after
the
people
who
deserve
the
credit
for
keeping
us
safe
for
seven
and
a
half
years.
I
don't
think
Dick
Cheney
is
worried
one
bit
about
being
investigated
for
anything.
I
think
he
honestly
thinks
this
is
outrageous.
And
I
think
he
is
right.
I
think
that
Cheney
is
right.
They
deserve
a
medal.
They
don't
deserve
to
have
it
hang
over
their
heads
and
the
careers
have
been
terribly
damaged
by
all
of
this.
So
just
let
it
go.
It
was
not
torture,
a
cruel,
inhuman
and
degrading
treatment
of
detainees
that
got
us
the
major
leads
that
ultimately
enabled
our
intelligence
community
to
find
Osama
bin
Laden.
Meantime,
FOX

has
obtained
a
letter
signed
by
34
Republican
senators

President

that

operation,

Hitting
a
rough
patch,
former
Pennsylvania
Senator
Rick
Santorum
is
at
odds
with
John
McCain
who
says
waterboarding

for

is
torture.

in

fits
within

including

say

should
send
the
case
to

This
person
is
accused
of
killing

they

And
that
is
a
war
crime
and
it
is
prosecutable
in

And
federal

more
capable
of

The

spokesman
had
no
comment
on

is
fine.

comes
off
as

Hang
on,
you
realize
Bin

would
still
be
alive
today
but
for
enhanced interrogations,
rendition,
black
sites
and
the
very
policies
he
imposed.
No,
I
acknowledge
he
gave
the
order,
which
was
I
think
was
the
right
to
do.
It
wouldn't
have
happened
because
we
wouldn't
have
had
the
intelligence,
but
for
George
Bush.
You
can
do
it.
I'm
not
going
to
say
that
torture
did
it,
but
I
will
say
---
there
was
a
long
list
of
intelligence
successes.
And
Bush
deserves
a
lot
of
credit.
--
torture
was
among
them
and
I
don't
think
torture
--
Does
Bush
deserve
any
credit?
Not
even
debatable.
It
is
not
even
debatable.
I'm
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the

in

almost
as
if

victory
tour,
received
by
the
huge
crowds.
The
mood
today
is
much
more
skeptical.

been
attacked
in
the
press
for,
quote/unquote
"executing"
bin

There

Go
to
Bernard
Goldberg.com
you
will
see
a
column
about
torture.
Mr.
Goldberg
has
some
strong
opinions
on
it.
He's
also
been
following
how
the
mainstream
media
is
covering
the
debate.
And
here
is
a
sample.
Interrogations,
the
counter-terror
policies
after
9/11
specifically
waterboarding.
General
Hayden
isn't
it
something
of
an
open
question
as
to
whether
that
--
you
can
tie
that
moment
to
this
moment?
It's
fair
to
look
at,
for
example,
again,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
But
he
actually
lied
about
the
courier
after
he
was
waterboarded
and
months
later
all
the
other
information
came
out.
This
is
just
a
muddle.
All
right.
Now,
look,
here's
my
provocative
question
for
you
tonight.
It's
a
little
speculation
but
Goldberg
and
I
have
both
worked
for
network
news.
I
think
that
we
can
make
these
comments
with
some
certainty.
If
you
walked
into
the
CBS
Evening
News
oval,
I
guess
they
call
it,
where
Couric
sits
and
all
the
producers
sit,
ok.
Fish
bowl,
right.
And
you
said
you
know
what?
I
changed
my
mind
on
coerced interrogation.
I
think
that
now
the
evidence
says
that
it
did
lead
to
capturing
bin
Laden,
at
least
in
part.
How
would
that
be
greeted,
Bernie,
if
you
uttered
that
opinion
at
CBS
News?
Well
CBS
News
under
the
new
management
it
might
not
be
greeted
as
partially
as
you
think
it
would.
Can
we
do
it
the
"New
York
Times"?
I
mean
they'd
look
at
me
and
say
wait
a
second.
Are
you
saying
that
waterboarding
is
ok
under
certain
circumstances?
And
if
I
said
yes,
I
would
be
marked.
I
would
be
marked
from
there
on
out.
Look
--
I'm
not
picking
on
CBS
News
--
right,
go
ahead.
Liberal
journalists
find
it
difficult
--
I'm
almost
tempted
to
say
--
understandably
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
something
that
they
find
reprehensible,
waterboarding
that
they
find
not
only
wrong
but
morally
wrong
could
lead
to
something
good,
the
take
But,
to
some
extent
--
bear
with
me
--
to
some
extent
it
is
muddled.
Howie
Kurtz
said
it
was
muddled.
To
some
extent,
it
is
in
this
respect.
I
don't
know
if
waterboarding,
even
though
a
lot
of
U.S.
officials
have
said
it
contributed
to
finding
the
courier
that
led
to
Osama
bin
Laden.
I
don't
know
if
it
helped
a
little
or
it
helped
a
lot.
And
I
do
know
that
a
lot
of
so-called
facts
after
the
op
So
tonight,
as
I
talk
to
you
tonight,
yes,
I
think
journalists
are
running
away
from
that
connection
because
they
are
journalists
--
they
are
liberals
and
liberals
don't
like
to
make
the
connection
between
something
that
they
consider
torture
and
somethin
Ok.
But
they
really
don't.
And
we
reported
last
week
with
Mark
Tiesen
(ph)
who
I
think
is
the
best
source
on
the
coerced interrogation
and
if
people
want
to
see
that
interview
I'm
going
to
have
it
posted
on
the
foxnation.com,
ok,
that
the
coerced interrog
Some
people
lied
about
it.
Some
people
didn't
lie
about
it.
They
gave
a
name
here.
They
gave
a
name
there.
But
the
information
that
they
were
able
to
get,
the
CIA
was
able
to
get
from
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
and
the
other
guy
that
was
coerced interrogation
Yet,
you
will
never
see
that
point
ceded
in
the
mainstream
media,
ever.
Right.
A
couple
of
points:
one,
I
believe
what
you
just
said
is
true.
I
believe
that
but
a
lot
of
the
high
ranking
U.S.
officials
who
say
it's
true
worked
in
the
Bush
administration
and
as
a
journalist
--
--
I
have
to
point
out
--
not
Panetta,
absolutely
true,
not
Panetta.
Not
Panetta
but
if
you
want
me
to
go
down
the
list
of
the
others,
almost
all
of
the
others
worked
in
the
Bush
administration.
That
doesn't
mean
they
are
not
telling
the
truth.
But
they
may
have
a
dog
in
the
fight.
That's
all
I'm
saying.
Now,
on
your
other
point,
journalists
will
run
away
from
this
connection
because,
as
I
say,
they
don't
like
the
fact
that
something
that
they
find
wrong
led
to
something
good.
I'm
going
to
go
deep
into
fantasy
land
right
now.
If
Barack
Obama
came
out
tomo
All
right.
As
we
look
into
this,
recently,
you
had
talked
at
length
that
you
said
Senator
McCain
was
wrong
or
doesn't
understand
enhancement interrogation
techniques.
And
there
was
a
backlash.
Because
obviously,
he'd
been
a
prisoner
of
war
for
five-and-a-
Which
of
course
I
knew.
What
I
was
talking
about
was
the
enhance interrogation
program
that
he
is
opposed,
and
I
have
supported
it.
And
so,
we,
there's
a
policy
difference
between
Senator
McCain
and
I.
He
got
up
and
wrote
an
article,
which
I
just
think
wa
I
think
that
our
enhanced interrogation
program
is
vital.
It
is
not
torture.
I
don't
believe
it
is
torture.
John
may
have
a
different
opinion.
But
I
don't
believe
it's
torture.
It
is
a
gradual
process,
it
aims
up,
it
attempts
to
get
people
to
break
folks

Would
we
have
gotten
Bin
Laden
but
for
enhanced interrogations,
Gitmo,
rendition,
black
sites?
Would
we
have
gotten
them
without
us?
I
don't
believe
we
would.
And
I
think,
even
if
you
read
the
letter
that
Leon
Panetta
sent
to
John
McCain
that
is
the
basis
for
his
article,
I
don't
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
says
that
we
wouldn't
have
gotten
him
without
it.
And
he
said,
there's
multipl
It
seems
like
the
name
of
the
courier,
at
least
the
nickname
first
came
from
KSM
in
Gitmo.
Now,
he
was
waterboarded,
and
it
seems
like
corroboration
or
suspicion
was
up
because
of
some
of
the
rendition
sites.
Right.
I
mean,
there
was
corroboration
interesting
enough
for
people
telling
us
the
truth.
And
then
lying
about
it.
And
then
also
people
lying
about
it,
when
we
knew
they
were
lying
about
it.
So,
sometimes,
you
know,
people
telling
you
the
truth
in
one
situation,
someone
is
telling
you
the
truth,
they
seem
broken.
And
then,
they
tell
an
obvious
lie
and
you
think,
wait

This
might
be
telling
us
something.
Yes.
This
might
be
telling
us
something
really
important.
So,
the
idea
that
well,
you
know,
sometimes
these
people
lie
after
they've
been
broken.
Well
yes,
and
that
sometimes
is
actually
the
most
important
piece
of
information.
But
that
led
to
the
nickname
which
lead
to
tracking
down
the
real
name
which
lead
to
eavesdropping
and
phone
calls
and
e-mails
which
led
to
Bin
Laden's
door.
I
mean,
this
is
the
thing
that
drives
me
crazy,
is
that
the
administration,
they
want
all

into
our
CIA
agents
who
should
be
treated
as

was

in

They

things
that

I
thought
it
was
a
gutsy
call.
But
here's
a
problem,
it
wouldn't
have
happened
if
his
policies
of
rendition,
black-ops
sites,
Gitmo,
enhanced interrogation.
All
these
things
wouldn't
have
happened
if
Barack
Obama
had
his
way.
Never
gave
Bush
credit.
President
Obama
is
getting
by
with
a
lot
of
help
from
his
friends
and
his
political
donors.
We'll
tell
you
about
it
later
in
"The
Grapevine."
But
first,
just
how
dangerous
is
the
threat
of
Muslim
radicalization?
Today's
second
congressional
hearing
on
Muslim
radicalization
was
preceded
by
much
less
resistance
than
the
first
event
back
in
March,
but
national
correspondent
Catherine
Herridge
reports
that
does
not
mean
it
was
free
of
rancor.
When
a
Democrat
questioned
the
legitimacy
of
hearings
on
Muslim
radicalization
in
prison
--
The
focus
of
one
particular
group
on
the
basis
of
race
or
religion
can
be
deemed
as
racist
and
is
discriminatory.
The
Republican
chairman
who
has
been
heavily
criticized
for
singling
out
radical
Islam
for
its
Homeland
Security
Committee
hearings
fired
back.
Your
party
had
control
of
this
committee
for
four
years.
Not
one
hearing
at
all,
anything
at
all
involving
prisons.
Suddenly
this
issue
emerges
when
we
start
talking
about
Muslim
radicalization.
Lawmakers
were
told
that
Jose
Padilla,
the
so-called
dirty
bomber
converted
to
radical
Islam
while
he
served
time
in
a
Florida
prison
for
assault.
After
his
release,
Padilla
traveled
overseas
and
joined
Al
Qaeda
where
he
plotted
to
attack
the
U.S.
after
9
Individuals
and
groups
that
subscribe
to
radical
Islamic
ideology
have
made
sustained
efforts
to
target
inmates
for
indoctrination.
Prisoners
by
their
very
nature
are
at
risk
and
susceptible
to
recruitment
and
radicalization
by
extremist
groups
because
of
their
isolation,
their
violent
tendencies
and
their
cultural
discontent.
And
the
post
9/11
case
at
California's
(INAUDIBLE)
prison
showed
the
problem
went
beyond
radical
religious
beliefs.
The
issue
that
we
have
with
Kevin
James
was
that
he
orchestrated
this
jihadist
plot
to
target
Jewish
persons
in
Southern
California
and
United
States
military
personnel.
He
quarterbacked
the
plot.
He
created
the
plot
from
the
prison.
Though
a
sociology
professor
from
Purdue
University
said
the
number
of
jihadist
plots
tied
to
prison
is
overshadowed
by
gangs
and
other
criminal
activity.
If
prisons
were
a
major
cause
of
jihadist
radicalization,
we
would
expect
to
see
a
lot
of
it.
But
we
don't.
Congressman
King
is
planning
a
third
round
of
hearings
in
July
which
focus
on
Americans
who
joined
Al
Qaeda
in
Yemen.
U.S.
counterterrorism
officials
say
the
group
represents
a
growing
threat
to
U.S.
national
security.
It

the
last

major

Still
ahead,
why
some
Republicans
want
to
take
two
prisoners
out
of
a
Kentucky
jail
and
send
them
to
Guantanamo
Bay.
But
first,
the
president's
decision
to
send
U.S.
forces
to
the
Libya
operation
still
a
sore
subject.
The
ongoing
battle
between
the
White
House
and
Congressional
Republicans
over
where
to
try
terror
suspects
has
a
new
focus
tonight.
National
correspondent
Catherine
Herridge
reports
it
involves
suspects
held
on
terror
charges
in
Kentucky.
The
case
of
two
Iraqi
nationals
who
face
trial
in
a
Kentucky
federal
court
is
reigniting
the
debate
over
whether
the
foreign
fighters
could
be
tried
in
U.S.
criminal
courts
or
sent
to
Guantanamo
Bay
for
interrogation
and
prosecution.
Guantanamo
is
the
perfect
place
for
foreign
terrorists
for
detention
and
interrogation.
It
is
also
if
prosecution
is
concluded
to
be
appropriate
the
perfect
place
for
the
military
commission
trials.
Among
charges
that
the
men
supported
Al
Qaeda
in
Iraq.
Connecticut
senator
and
minority
leader
said
they
should
be
interrogated
long-term
at
Guantanamo
to
learn
more
about
Al
Qaeda
in
Iraq.
Last
week,
as
part
of
the
confirmation
hearing,
the
CIA
director

Senator,
I
have
to
tell
you,
there
are
1,000
Al
Qaeda
that
are
still
in
Iraq.
While
not
specifically
addressing
the
Kentucky
case,
the
attorney
general
said
Thursday
the
military
commissions
are
untested.
The
civilian
law
enforcement
and
article
our
ability
to
disrupt,
dismantle
and
defeat
terror
plot
to
secure
actionable
intelligence
to
enlist
international
cooperation.
Senator
McConnell
says
the
Iraqi
suspects
are
not
owed
the
same
right
as
Americans
in
federal
court.
A
Justice
Department
spokesman
says
the
transferring
of
suspects
from
the
U.S.
to
Guantanamo
has
never
been
done
and
it's
not
clear
it
would
be
legal.
The
whole
intelligence
debate
is
still
to
be
had
on
whether
the
information
--
if
it
was
under
distress
and
if
that's
what
lead
to
--
Black
sites,
interrogations,
enhanced interrogations
and
Gitmo.
Remember
we
got
word
that
the
courier
was
close
to
Bin
Laden.
We
got
the
nickname.
The
nickname
led
to
the
real
name.
The
real
name
led
to
the
guy.
We
don't
know
what
techniques
were
exactly
used
because
the
best
information
usually
does
not
come
from
torture.
It
comes
from
long
term
sustained
manipulation
and
building
rapport.
You
worked
for
Condoleeza
Rice.
Do
you
think
she
supported
torture?
No,
I'm
saying
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
Wait
a
minute,
we
used
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
Do
you
think
the
techniques
used
in
the
Bush
years
were
torture?
I
think
you
are
sticking
up
for
your
old
boss.
I
would
say
enhanced,
you
know,
intelligence
techniques,
but
you
know,
they've
said
that
they
were
only
used
on
very
few
occasions.
We
obtained
that
information
through
waterboarding
and
so
for
those
who
say
that
waterboarding
doesn't
work,
who
say
that
it
should
be
stopped,
and
never
used
again,
we
got
vital
information
which
directly
led
us
to
bin
Laden.
Wait,
wait
let
me
stop
you
there,
I
did
not
know
that
and
I'm
sure
most
of
my
audience
did
not
at
all.
Explain
how
that
went
down.
How
did
we
get
that
information?
Where
did
it
come
from?
Was
it
Guantanamo
Bay?
It
came
from
an
overseas
prison
where
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
was
being
interrogated.
And
waterboarding
was
used
and
it
was
during
the
interrogation
of
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
through
waterboarding.
--
I
said
it
based
on
a
Pentagon
report
from
2002.
But
you
believed
it.
But
secondly,
secondly,
I
do
believe
it.
Ok,
still?
Yes.
Donald
Rumsfeld
said
--
--
this
was
not
a
result
of
waterboarding.
Well,
wait,
wait,
you
don't
want
to
hear
what
Rumsfeld,
he
doesn't
know
what
he's
talking
about?
Candidly?
I
don't
want
to
hear
what
Rumsfeld
has
to
say.
That's
what
he
said.
He's
Defense
Secretary.
Because
I
--
we
confirmed
today,
we
confirmed
today
that
what
Peter
King,
the
congressman,
the
head
of
the
national
security,
said
on
this
broadcast
absolutely
true.
Well,
Rumsfeld
says
otherwise.
Well,
I
don't
care
what
Rumsfeld
talks
about.
Ok,
he
was
the
Defense
Secretary.
Rumsfeld
wants
to
sit
here,
I
guarantee
you,
I'll
hear
a
different
story.
I'm
quoting
the
defense
secretary
of
the
United
States
Mr.
O'Reilly.
And
he
said
no.
All
right,
so
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
coerced interrogation
did
lead
to
the
initial
--
That's
your
opinion.
And
you
don't
believe
it?
I
don't
believe
it.
All
right,
so
you'll
never
believe
it.
No,
I
didn't
say,
I'll
never
believe
it.
You're
like
a
doubting
Thomas.
You
want
to
put
your
hand
in
the
side
of
the

According
--
according
to
timeline,
according
to
the
timeline,
enhanced interrogation
and
the
waterboarding
took
place
in
2002
and
2003.
It
was
2006
at
the
time
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
released
the
names
of
the
courier.
If
you
--
if
you
look.
No,
that's
not
true.
He
released
the
information
about
who
the
courier
was.
They
couldn't
find
his
name
and
they
tracked
it
down.
You
believe
it
obviously.
And
I
must
say
that
--
that
Crowley
wants
to
believe
it
and
Colmes
doesn't
w
No
this

the
Republicans
to
burnish
the
image
of
George
W.
Bush.
Can
you,
can
you
--
well,
wait,
wait
can
you
--
are
you
able
tonight
to
convince
your
brother-in-law
that
he
is
wrong?
Can
you
do
that?
I
will
certainly
try
although
it
might
require
waterboarding.
Before
we
had
this
weekend's
developments
we
had
a
number
of
intelligence
reports
stating
that
the
enhanced interrogation

just
waterboarding
but

making
them
stand
for
extended
periods
of
time,

Now,
we
have
this
weekend
where
we've
got
the
chairman
of
the
House
Homeland
Security
Committee
Peter
King,
saying
exactly
that.
That
what
we
were
able
to
discern
after
subjecting

it

But
we
were
able
to
conduct
those
enhanced interrogation
techniques
on
this
people
then.
And
next,
"Is
It
Legal,"
with
more
on
the
verdict
today.
Also,
Attorney
General
Holder
gives
up
the
CIA
interrogation
witch-hunt.
"Legal"
is
next.
Thanks
for
staying
with
us.
I'm
Bill
O'Reilly
and
in
the
"Is
it
Legal?"
segment
tonight.
Three
hot
topics
including
Attorney
General
Holder
announcing
that
most
of
the
CIA
investigations
or
coerced
investigations
of
terrorists
being
dropped.
We
predicted

That
President
Obama
and
Attorney
General
Holder
would
drop
the
CIA
witch
hunt
into
the
interrogation
of
terrorists,
you
know,
the
water
boarding
and
stuff
like
that.
And
so
they
have.
Yes,
they
have.
But
listen,
why
this
was
even
revisited?
For
political
reasons.
Of
course
it
was.
That's
improper,
as
well.
They
are
wasting
time
and
our
taxpayer
dollars
on
a
political
witch-hunt.
But
tell
the
folks
where
it
stands
now.
Let's
move
it
ahead.
I'll
tell
you.
Leon
Panetta
made
the
announcement
right
before
he
left
as
director
of
the
CIA
that
they
would
be
dropping
the
majority
of
the
investigations.
So
there's
one
case
in
question,
right?
Two
total
cases
in
question,
and
they
are
both
cases
where
deaths
occurred
in
questioning.
And
one
was
at
Abu
Ghraib
in
a
shower
when
questioning
happened
and
the
man
died.
The
alleged
terrorist
being
questioned
died
and,
two
--
and
that's
legitimate,
ladies
and
gentlemen.
If
they
died
they
may
have
to
be
--
they
have
to
be
investigated.
You've
got
career
prosecutors
saying
they
looked
at
those
cases
and
they
would
decline
any
prosecution.
But
you
know
what,
Wiehl?
I'm
cynical
enough
on
all
government
to
say
I'm
going
to
do
my
own
investigation.
If
I'm
the
attorney
general,
you've
got
two
people
in
American
custody,
they're

or
not,
and
they're

in

Steve,
on

And
just
a

of
weeks
ago,
you
had
Admiral

in

of

being
asked
about
the

policy
broadly.
And
he
said

would
be
nice
to

and
to

them.
There
is
such
a
place,
of
course,
and
it's
Guantanamo

Cuba.
I
think
one
of
the
things
that
this
makes
clear
is
the

is

There

it

is.

I

shows

I
don't
know
that
they
will,
but
they
are
struggling
with
the
Guantanamo

policy,
which
is
to
abandon

clearly.
What
I
think
that

is
that

they're

Well,
the
one
thing
that
constant
is
the

aversion
to

to

of
the

in

arguments
about

they

can
all
be
a
part
of
the
process.
I
think
the
vast
majority
of
people
recognize
that
all
those
things
that
we
do
are
for
their
own
safety
and
protection.
But
there
are
some
skeptics
like
Republican
Congressman
Jason
Chaffetz
who
says
he
worries
we're
engaged
more
in,
quote,
"security
theater
than
actually
being

We've
had

breaches.

And
I
regret
that.
But
I
also
think
that

of
the
things
that

were
very
laudable.

The

has
not

Guantanamo,
but
he
has
outlawed
the

and
told
NBC

his
policies
have
made
America
safer.
There`s
no
question
but
that
a
lot
of
al

have
been
captured
or
killed.
And
that`s
a
good
thing.
The
reality
is,
however,
I
don`t
personally
feel
that
I
have
a
good
grip
on
the
number
of
people
being

of
knowledge
of
that
or
certainty
about

metrics
that
we
can
actually

I
think
is
a
problem.

it`s
a
competition

ideas,

Well,
I
agree
very
much
with

we`ve
made
major
progress
in

I
worry
that
the

to
bring
home
the
surge

early
is
going
to
raise
the
risk,
if
you
will,
in
that
part
of
the
world.
I
think
that
the

itself,

They`ve
now
backed
off
that,
supposedly,
but
I
thought
that
was
a
terrible
precedent
to
set
and
they`ve
had
to
keep
Guantanamo
open
because
it
makes
sense,
it`s
a
good
facility.

9/11,
with
some
of
the
legal
structure,
the
counterterrorism
architecture
that
was
created
with
warrantless
wireless
wiretaps
and
Patriot
Act,
there
were
critics
who
said
that
our
civil
liberties
were
in
jeopardy.
Do
you
see
any
sign
that's
happened?
Well,
I
think
there's
always
--
you
have
to
be
vigilant
about
that.
But
I
think
what
is
striking
about
it
is
how
--
you
know,
I
don't
think
any
--
very
many
Americans
to
speak
of
have
any
worry
about
their
civil
liberties.
I
mean,
whereas
speech
is
as
free
as
it's
ever
been,
except
for
political
correctness,
and
that's
not
a
function
of
the
war
on
terror.
You
know,
debates
are
as
robust
as
ever.
I
have
no
worries
about
my
multitudinous
communications
on
the
Internet
or
anywhere
else
being
supervised
by
some
government
official
somewhere.
I
just
don't
worry
about
that
very
much,
and
I
don't

I
would
say
that,
if
you
look
at
the
Congress,
though
--
and
this
picks
up
on
what
Dana
was
saying
--
the
Congress
essentially
gave
a
blank
check
to
the
executive,
to
the
president,
and
said
do
what
you
need
to
prevent
future
attacks.
And
I
think
that
has
really
damaged
their
strength
on
national
security
issues.
It's
as
if
they
are
just
not
participating.
You
look
at
the
recent
U.S.
intervention
in

The
most
controversial
course
is
the

I'm
curious,
but
obviously
I
know
that
you
supported
it

you
wouldn't

When
we
got
into
enhanced interrogation,

that's
the
one
held
out
as
the
rough
stuff,
that
was
done
on

don't

or
something
there
is
going
to
be
some
slippery
slope
that
was
accepted
now
will
be
used
beyond
that?
I
don't
think
so.
Our
concern,
Greta,
was
on
the
morning
after
9/11
that
when
--
and
the
president
was
very
strong
in
this
as
well,
that
we
were
not
ever
going
to
let
that
happen
again
on
our
watch.
And
we
were
going
to
do
whatever
we
had

what

Earlier

of

a
major
blow
to

reaction
has
been
largely
positive
on
the
effort
of
the

to
taking
out

but
as
you
might
imagine,

put
out
a
statement
immediately
saying,
quote,
"The

likes
these
kind
of
people,
but
I
also
like
the

and
I
like
our

the
Fifth
Amendment
that
you
don't
just
target
people
and
assassinate
them.
The
same
people
who
were
hysterical
over
the
mastermind
of
the
9/11
attacks,
being
waterboarding
think
that
killing
somebody
without
bringing
charges
against
them
or

is
completely
acceptable.
In
this

I
personally
this
is
very
chilling.
I
agree
with

not
made

public
case
that

only
place
I

is

communication
issue.
I
think

White
House
created
a
mess
for
itself
not
simply
making
the
case
better
and
explaining
it.
Everywhere
else
I
completely
disagree.
The
reason
I
didn't
go
for
an
indictment
because
this
guy
is
not
a
criminal.
He
is
an
enemy
combatant.
There
is
no
way
to
serve
him
with
indictment
or
a
warrant
if
you
wanted
to,
because
he
is
in
the
hinterlands

I
think
the
policy
of
killing
the
guys
rather
than
capturing
them
is
ill-conceived
because
you
want
to
find
out
what
they
know.
But
Obama
is
afraid
to
bring
the
guys
back
because
it's
somehow
portion
to
put
them
in

than
to
kill
them.
This
is
another
But
the
idea
that
the
constitution
bars
this,
I
don't
get
it.
The
constitution
charges
the
president
putting
down
insurrection.
George
Washington
didn't
violate
the
constitution
when
he
put
down
the
Whiskey
Rebellion.
The
2001
law
put
forward
by
Congress

But
the
constitution
always
trumps
a
law
passed
by
Congress.
And
the
constitution
says

cannot
deny

and
you
can't

It
says

can

and
everybody
agreed
it's

of

We've
seen
the
Supreme
Court
rule
over
and
over
even
if
he
wasn't
an
enemy
combatant
he
has
constitutional
right.
He
is
an
American.
I'll
bet
you
the
court
does
not
have
a
problem
with
this.
We
had
a
civil
war
in
which
our
side
mowed
down
American

point
is

Normally

say

on

again.

now

takes

That
is
precisely
the
point.
The

itself,
undermined
its
case
in
the

case
by
insisting
over
and
over
again
on

having
all
of

rights,

being
illegitimate

and
now
the

to

I
think
the
question
you
ask
at
Charles
gets
to
the
heart
of
it.
If
you
have
a
philosophical
assumption
that
the
people
are
criminals
that
should
be
treated
as
criminals,
and
particularly
if
they're
American
criminals,
then
it's
outrageous
that
they're
ki
I
don't
share
that
assumption.
I
think
they
are
enemy
combatants
as
part
of
an
international
terrorist
organization
we
formally
declared
war
against
and
we
can
kill
them.
That
is
not
the
position
of
the
White
House.
It
is
a
huge
contradiction.
Charles,
this
helps
the
president
make
his
case
that
he
is
tough
on
terror
and
it
helps
in
his
reelection
bid?
It
does.
In
fact,
he
killed
a
lot
of
bad
guys,
conducting
a
war
in
Afghanistan.
I
think
it
definitely
is
a
plus
for
him,
and
it
should
be.

In

segment
tonight,

is
constitutional.

killing
of

leader

American
citizen
who
was

All
right.
Now,
today,
Reuters
writes
an
article
that
says,
"Secret
panel"
--
secret
panel
--
"to
put
Americans
on
the
kill
list."
Now
I
assume
I'm
on
that
list.
Doesn't
name
who
the
panel
people
are.
Doesn't
name
how
they
know
it.
Totally
blind
source.
Says
there
was
one
American
on
that
list
and
we
just
killed
him,
al
Awlaki.
But
they
imply
in
the
article,
Reuters,
that
there's
this
little
panel
that
sits
in
the
White
House
basement
and
then
says,
"You
can
kill
him."
Which
drives
Congressman
Ron
Paul
right
up
the
wall.
Because
you
can't
do
that.
Does
the
president
have
the
power
to
launch
--
constitutionally,
to
launch
these
missiles
and
kill
people
like
al-Awlaki?
It
depends.
I
think
so,
but
it's
murky.
You
have
to
prove,
basically,
that
the
person
is
an
imminent
threat.
And
if
he's
not
an
imminent
threat,
you
have
to
have
statutory
authority.
And
what
the
White
House
has
said
here
was
he
was
an
imminent
threat,
because
not
only
did
this
guy,
Awlaki,
participate
in
past
terrorist
attacks,
we
think,
but
he
was
planning
other
attacks,
or
we
have
reason
to
believe
he
was
going
to,
you
know,
do
oth
Imminent
doesn't
necessarily
have
the
same
meaning
legally
as
you
and
I
know
it,
you
know,
colloquially.
So
they
may
have
an
argument
there
that
it
was
imminent.
If
it's
not
imminent,
they
point
to
the
statutory
authority
that
authorizes
us
to
go
kill
anybody
who
was
attached
to
al
Qaeda
after
9/11.
That's
fine.
But
the
problem
for
them..
Where
does
that
statutory
authority
come
from?
It's
--
remember
after
we
got
attacked
on
9/11...
...
it's
called
the
AUMF,
the
Authorization
for
Use
of
Military
Force,
and
that's
what
Congress
passed
to
allow
us
to
go
fight
back.
But
they
didn't
pass
a
declaration
of
war.
No,
but
this
allowed
--
this
is
the
document.
That
allowed
the
Bush
administration...
To
go
in...
...
to
aggressively
go
after
terrorists...
...
and
kill
al
Qaeda.
...
because
Congress
passed
it.
Right.
But
the
problem,
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
statutory
language,
is
it
technically
only
allows
you
to
kill
people
who
were
responsible
for
9/11.
Not
necessarily
all
the
stuff
that
happens
after.
You
can
make
--
look,
the
drone
program
is
directed
at
Taliban
and
al
Qaeda
terrorists.
The
Taliban
allowed
al
Qaeda
to
hatch
the
plot,
so
anybody
under
that
banner...
But
it's
not
really
retroactive
or
forward
looking
like
that.
Here's
what
happened.
People
saw
this.
They
saw
that
it
was
getting
a
little
outdated.
You
know,
here
we
are,
10
years
later,
said
we
need
to
freshen
it
up.
The
Republicans
in
particular
said,

And
the
Democrats
balked
at
that,
because
they
believed
that
it
would
give
retroactive
permission
to
the
Bush
administration
for
all
those
enhanced interrogations.
So
we
need
to
freshen
that...
So
--
so
the
Obama
administration
has
been
more
aggressive
using
the
drone
and
Hellfire
missile
strikes
than
the
Bush
administration
was.
Yes.
Yes.
So
you're
telling
me
they
don't
really
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
I'm
saying
I
think
they
do.
They
have
a
good
argument
that
it
was
an
imminent
threat.
Not
just
with
al-Awlaki.
They're
blowing
people
up
in
Pakistan
every
day
now.
Well,
obviously
this
is
dicier,
because
it's
an
American
citizen.
And
you've
got
to
look
to,
you
know,
what
the
Constitution
affords
--
what
protections
it
affords
American
citizens.
But
what
I'm
saying
is
they'd
be
on
better
footing
if
they
had
agreed
to
update
the
AMUF,
the
authorization.
So
write
another
bill
that
Congress
could
consider
and
pass
that
gives
them
the
authority
to
use
these
drones
more?
If
it's
a
declared
war
--
remember
back
in
World
War
II,
when
this
happened
--
it's
fine.
But
let
me
say
this.
I
know
there
are
some
technical
reasons.
Go
ahead.
But
let
me
say
this.
This
guy,
al-Awlaki's,
father
actually
went
into
court
a
couple
years
ago
and
said,
"They're
going
to
take
out
my
son."
Yes,
"Get
my
kid's
name
off
the
list."
Right?
Yes.
"They're
going
to
take
out
my
son."
He
lost
because
it
was
an
important
ruling
from
the
court
out
of
D.C.,
the
federal
court,
saying
the
courts
aren't
going
to
get
involved
in
this
kind
of
thing.
That's
a
political
thing.
Courts
--
it's
not
our
province
to
tell
a
president
when
he
can
go
af
Once
he
gets
into
the
constitutional
realm,
then
the
courts
have
to.
No,
because
they
were
--
he
was
raising
arguments
like
that.
And
they
said,
when
it
comes
to
certain
issues,
we
bow
out.
It's
not
up
to
the
court
to
tell
an
American
president
when
it's
OK
to
go
after
a
citizen.
So
even
if

So
you

that,

the

Yes.

think
Ron

going
to
be
disappointed.
The
Al

offshoot
in
Yemen
is
confirming
the
death
of

cleric
Anwar
al-Awlaki.
Al

Peninsula

and
three
others

killed

month

American
airstrike.
The

vowing
to
avenge
those
deaths.
All
right.

him,

on
him,
for
what?
Because
they
say
he

crimes
when
he
authorized,
in
their
words,
torture.
enhanced interrogations.
So
it's
the
same
old
stuff?
And
they
figure
the
Canadian
government
may
be
sympathetic
to
this?
They
feel
that
President
Obama
has
been
derelict
in
his
duties
in
not
arresting
our
former
president.
And
now
they
are
looking
to
Canada
to
step
in
where
the
United
States
would
not
to
arrest
our
former
president,
so
he
can
go
be
tried.
What
are
the
odds
that
the
Mounties
surround
Bush's
hotel
and
kick
the
door
in?
I
would
say
between
slim
and
none,
and

That
would
be
war.
Then
we'd
have
to
invade
Canada.
It's
so
ridiculous.
Probably
should
have
done...
This
was
once
a
legitimate
group,
Amnesty
International.
You
know?
I
mean,
this
kind
of
stuff
does
not
help
their
cause.
You've
got
to
understand,
it's
like
the
ACLU.
They
want
it,
too.
Yes.
They
get
their
hardcore
far-left
people
giving
them
money.
They're
not
going
to
convince
anybody
else.
I
mean,
they're
just
far
out
there.
And
you
know,
you
--
they
stand
for
some
legitimate
issues.
Human
rights,
which
are
being
abused.
But
did
they
go
to
Canada
and
say,
when
Fidel
Castro
went
there,
that
they
wanted
him
arrested?
No,
of
course
not.
How
about
Ahmadinejad?
Do
they
want
him
arrested?

Pre
In
the
"Weekdays
with
Bernie"
segment
tonight,
there
were
two
interesting
reporter
exchanges
over
the
weekend.
First
one
at
the
Republican
debate,
where
CBS
News
anchor
Scott
Pelley
challenged
Newt
Gingrich
about
killing
terrorists.
Speaker
Gingrich,
if
I
could
ask
you
the
same
question.
As
president
of
the
United
States,
would
you
sign
that
death
warrant
for
an
American
citizen
overseas
who
you
believe
is
a
terrorist
suspect?
Well,
he's
not
a
terrorist
suspect.
He's
a
person
who
was
found
guilty
under
a
review
of
actively
seeking
the
death
of
Americans.
Not
found
guilty
by
a
court,
sir.
He
was
found
guilty
by
a
panel
that
looked
at
it
and
reported
to
the
president.
Well,
that's
extra-judicial.
It's
not
the
rule
of
law.
Based
upon
the
ACLU
lawsuits
and
others
that
have
been
slapped
down,
because
I
would
have
gone
by
the
unsettled
deal.
Courts
have
not
said
you
can't
do
that.
And
so
that's
what
happened.
That's
a
multiple
choice
question,
isn't
it?
Let
me
just
say
this.
They're
wrong.
All
right.
So,
a
lot
of
people
say,
look,
the
CNN
reporter
is
sympathetic
to
President
Obama's
point
of
view
by
baiting
him
that
way.
And
you
say?
Well,
look,
when
I
first
saw
this,
I
thought
it
was
a
"Saturday
Night
Live"
comedy
routine.
Are
you
kidding?
I
mean,
a
reporter
from
a
major
news
organization
asking
if
Republicans
are
uninformed,
out
of
touch,
or
irresponsible?
President
Obama
even
looke
He
looked
perplexed.
The
only
escape
hatch
that
Mr.
Lothian
has
is
if
he
was
going
for
this
big
reaction.
You
know,
he
wanted
to
provoke
Mr.
Obama
to
say
these
people
are
pinheads.
He
has
no
--
no
escape
hatch.
That
was
the
most
ridiculous
question
I
have
ever
heard
by
a
regular
reporter
from
a
so-called
mainstream
news
outfit.
Ever.
Thank
God.
Because
I
think
some
of
mine
have
broached
that
territory.
But
I'm
glad
he
topped
me.
If
I
were
president,
I
would
be
willing
to
use
water
boarding.
I
think
it
was
very
effective.
Torture
is
illegal.
And
by
our
laws,
it's
illegal
by
international
law.
We
should
not
torture.
Water
boarding
is
torture.
On
the
Senate
floor,
the
Obama
administration
was
chided
for
promising
to
close
Gitmo
and
failing,
for
promising
to
try
the
9/11
suspects
in
a
federal
court
and
failing,
for
lacking
a
clear
policy
for
the
detention
and
questioning
of
terror
suspects.
If
today,
we
capture
Zawahiri,
the
leader
of
al
Qaeda,
what
would
we
do
with
him?
The
requirement
to
detain
a
person
in
military
custody
does
not
include
U.S.
citizens,
but
it
would
cover
al
Qaeda
terrorists
arrested
on
U.S.
soil.
Is
America
part
of
the
battlefield?
You
better
believe
it's
part
of
the
battlefield.
The
administration
could
use
a
national
security
waiver
to
send
some
cases
to
the
FBI
and
ultimately
criminal
courts.
Concessions
were
made
to
the
White
House.
They
want
flexibility.
That's
exactly
what
we
provide
in
this
amendment.
Yet,
the
White
House
calls
the
detainee
language,
quote,
"unwise
and
unwarranted
restrictions
to
combat
terrorism."
Key
Democrats
agreed.
I
view
the
detention
provisions
of
this
bill
as
really
pernicious
as
an
attack
on
the
executive
power
of
the
president.
The
bill
also
codifies
indefinite
detention
but
prohibits
Gitmo
detainees
from
being
brought
to
the
U.S.
mainland
using
defense
department
funds
--
Shannon.
On
the
issue
of
TSA
airport
pat-downs,
Rick
Santorum
proposed
ethnic
and
religious
profiling.
The
folks
who
are
most
likely
to
be
committing
these
crimes
if
you
look
at
--
I
mean,
obviously,
Muslims
would
be
someone
you'd
look
at.
Absolutely.
Those
are
the
folks
who
are
the
radical
Muslims
or
the
people
that
are
committing
these
crimes.
But
not
all
agreed.
What
if
they
look
like
Timothy
McVeigh?
Isn't
it,
well,
that
is
a
big
part
of
the
decision.
But
it
really
was
ten
years
in
the
making
when
you
think,
OK,
war
on
terror,
Tora
Bora,
all
the
way
through
the
killing
of
Bin
Laden.
In
between,
you
have
enhanced interrogations,
black
sights,

Absolutely.
And
what
happened
in
the
last
two
years,
three
years
is
that
they
were
able
to
start
connecting
the
dots.
And
even
so,
there
was
not
surety.
They'd
tried
to
get
in
before.
They'd
lost
him
in
Tora
Bora.
There
was
a
CIA
operative
in
Khartoum
in

See,
but
this
bothers
me.
Because
all
right,
I'll
even
give
Panetta
the
credit
that
you're
giving
him,
here
is
what
I
think
is
missing
though.
I
don't
see
Obama
changing
on
rendition,
black
sites,
Gitmo,
enhanced interrogation.
I
think
ideologically
he
is
The
president
made
some
very,
very
big
decisions,
like
the
terrorist
surveillance
program
or
the
enhanced interrogation
program,
the
decisions
with
respect
to
Afghanistan
and
Iraq.
These
were
life-and-death
decisions
really.
And
I
felt,
after
he
took
over,
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
him
to
immediately
launch
on
a
campaign
to
try
to
close
Guantanamo
and
shut
down
our
interrogation
program
and
dramatically
reduce
our
presence
in
various
places
where
we
had
difficult
assignments

Well,
he
has,
in
some
respects,
retreated
from
those
positions
he
took
early
on
in
the
first
weeks
of
his
administration.
Guantanamo
is
still
open;
they
still
have
military
commissions
for
trying
terrorism
suspects
and
so
forth.
Back
in
this
country,
the
problem
of
homegrown
terrorists
targeting
military
installations
was
the
subject
of
an
unprecedented
meeting
today
on
Capitol
Hill.
Chief
intelligence
correspondent,
Catherine
Herridge,
has
that
story.
Since
9/11,
there
have
been
at
least
33
plus
targeting
the
U.S.
military,
including
the
Ft.
Hood
massacre
where
the
alleged
shooter,
an
army
major,
killed
13
and
wounded
at
least
30
others.
American
service
members
and
their
families
are
increasingly
in
the
terrorist
scope.
The
first
joint
session
of
the
Senate
and
House
Homeland
Security
Committees
was
told
that
Islamist
extremists
see
the
military
as
fair
game
because
of
a
false
Jihadist
narrative
that
the
U.S.
is
at
war
with
their
religion.
Are
there
cases
within
the
military
right
now
involving
perspective
Jihaddists?
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
answer
that
question
in
closed
session.
Lawmakers
clash
over
semantics.
Focusing
on
followers
that
want
a
religion
as
the
only
creditable
threat
to
the
nation
security
is
inaccurate.
Our
military
is
open
to
all
phase.
We
should
be
able
to
identify
the
enemy
and
its
violent
radical
Islamic
extremism.
A
senior
Republican
cited
this
letter
to
show
how
the
defense
department
deals
with
such
threats.
It
is
dealing
with
the
threat
of
violence
Islamist
extremism
in
the
context
of
the
broader
threat
of
workplace
violence.
Defense
department
witnesses
responded.
The
primary
threat
to
security
(ph)
at
home
comes
from
al
Qaeda.
The
attack
by
a
lone
gunman
outside
an
Arkansas
recruitment
center
killed
Private
William
Long.
Long's
father
said
the
army
betrayed
his
family
by
refusing
to
immediately
call
it
an
act
of
terrorism.
They
wore
these
when
he
took
four
rounds
of
7.62
ammo
from
about
three
feet.
On
it,
there's
the
warrior
ethos.
The
last
line
of
it
is,
"I
will
never
leave
a
fallen
comrade."
Well,
the
army
left
him.
And
lawmakers
were
told
the

is
a
driving
force
behind

First
one
at
the
Republican
debate
where
CBS
News
Anchor
Scott
Pelley
challenged
Newt
Gingrich
about
killing
terrorists.
Speaker
Gingrich,
if
I
could
just
ask
you
the
same
question.
As
President
of
the
United
States,
would
you
sign
that
death
warrant
for
an
American
citizen
overseas
who
you
believe
is
a

Well,
he
is
not
a
terrorist
suspect.
He
is
person
who
was
found
guilty
under

of

Not
found

by
a

sir.
He
was
found
guilty
by
a
panel
that
looked
at
it
and
reported
to
the
President.
Now
let
me
tell
you
a
story
--
Well
that's
extrajudicial
it's
not
the
rule
of
law.
It
is
the
rule
of
law.
If
you
engage
in
war
against
the
United
States
you
are
an
enemy
combatant.
You
have
none
of
the
civil
liberties
of
the
United
States.
You
cannot
go
to
court.
Civil
defense,
criminal
defense
is
a
function
of
being
within
the
American
law.
Waging
war
on
the
United
States
is
outside
criminal
law,
it
is
an
act
of
war
and
should
be
dealt
with
as
an
act
of
war
and
the
correct
thing
in
an
act
of
war
is
to
kill
people
who
are
trying
to
kill
you.
So
a
lot
of
people
thought,
including
Brit
Hume
that
Scott
Pelley
betrayed
his
bias
there,
you
know,
that
he
thought
that
criminal
court
should
take
care
of
this
and
that
Washington
shouldn't
have
the
power
to
obliterate
people
based
on
a
secret
panel's
r
I
think
Pelley
did
betray
a
little
bit
of
his
belief,
what
say
you?
You
know,
I
have
been
following
this
debate
all
day
tonight
today.
And
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
people
who
I
respect
tremendously
whose
political
opinions
I
respect
and
whose
intellect
I
respect.
And
I'm
just
on
the
other
side
of
this
one.
What
did
Scott
Pelley
do
that
was
wrong?
He
asked
a
question:
if
you
were
president,
Mr.
Gingrich,
would
you
sign
off
on
killing
a
suspected
terrorist
who
is
an
American
who
is
overseas?
And
who
hasn't
had
a
tri
Gingrich
said
yes,
you
don't
need
a
trial.
If
a
panel
has
found
you
to
be
an
enemy
combatant,
you
don't
have
any
civil
rights.
You
have
no
right
to
a
trial.
We
can
kill
you.
And
Pelley
says
what?
He
says,
but
you
haven't
been
found
guilty
in
a
court
of
law.
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
what's
--
where
did
Scott
Pelley
cross
the
line
here?
Well,
I
think
he
said
the
rule
of
law,
but
a
court
of
law;
basically
implying
that
if
you
agree
with
speaker
Gingrich
then
you
don't
have
any
use
for
the
rule
of
law.
Look
the
courts
have
decided,
at
least
on
the
lower
courts,
the
president
has
the
power
to
order
these
assassinations,
attacks
--
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
He
can
do
it.
All
right.
So
that's
what
we're
even
adjudicating
in
the
legal
system
and
that's

Look,
this
is
the
way
the
system
works.
It's
been
defined
by
the
courts.
I
think
it
should
be
defined
by
Congress
so
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
--
that's
what
my
belief
is
but
Pelley
seems
to
think
that
it
is
a
violation
of
rule
of
law
because
that's
what
Well,
he
may
be
right,
you
know.
Because
I
got
off
the
phone
just
minutes
ago
with
Judge
Napolitano,
somebody
who
is
pretty
knowledgeable
about
things
like
this.
He
says
at
absolute
best
it's
unsettled
law
and
frankly,
according
to
Judge
Napolitano
you
ar
I'm
willing
to
accept
that
it's
unsettled.
But
I'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
all
my
conservative
friends
who
I
have
tremendous
respect
for
and
by
the
way
I
have
tremendous
respect
for
Newt
Gingrich.
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
where
did
Scott
Pelley
--

I
mean
a
moderator
is
supposed
to
ask
questions.
He
asked
a
legitimate
question.
He
asked
follow-ups
about
--
well,
he
wasn't.
Gingrich
brought
up
the
term
"guilty".
Gingrich
said
"guilty"
and
Scott
Pelley
said
and
I
think
you
would
have
said,
Bill.
Well

I
don't
know
whether
I
would
have
said
that
--
Then
Gingrich
went
on
to
explain
his
position.
--
based
upon
the
ACLU
lawsuit
and
the
others
that
had
been
slapped
out
because
I
would
have
gone
by
the
unsettled
deal.
Courts
have
not
said
you
can't
do
that
that's
what
happened.
Last
night
of
the
republic
debate
some
of
the
hopefuls
--
they
hope
to
get
your
job
--
they
defended
the
practice
of
waterboarding
which
is
a
practice
that
you
banned
in
2009.
Herman
Cain
said,
quote,
"I
don't
see
that
as
torture"
and
Michele
Bachmann
said
that
it's
quote,
"very
effective."
So
I'm
wonder
if
you
think
that
they
are
uninformed,
out
of
touch
or
irresponsible?
That's
a
multiple
choice
question,
isn't
it?
Let
me
just
say
this,
they
are
wrong.
Russia's
foreign
ministry
is
criticizing
the
U.S.
for
its
human
rights
record.
It
attacks
President
Obama
for,
quote,
"legalizing
indefinite
and
extrajudicial
custody
and
return
of
court
martials."
It
also
laments
the
ongoing
operation
of
what
it
calls
th
Speaker
Gingrich,
if
I
could
just
ask
you
the
same
question.
As

the
United
States,
would
you
sign
that

for
an
American
citizen

Well,
he's
not
a
terrorist
suspect.
He's
a
person
who
was
found
guilty
under
review
of
actively
seeking
the
death
of

Not

not
found
guilty

He's
found
guilty
by
a
panel
that
looked
at
it
and
reported
to
the
President.
But
let
me
--
let
me
tell
you
a
story
--
Well,
that's
extrajudicial
it's
not
the
rule
of
law.
It
is
a
rule
of
law.
If
you
engage
in
war
against
the
United
States
you
are
an
enemy
combatant.
You
have
none
of
the
civil
liberties
of
the
United
States.
You
cannot
go
to
court.
Civil
defense,
criminal
defense
is
a
function
of
being
within
the
American
law.
Waging
war
on
the
So
a
lot
of
people
thought,
including
Brit
Hume
that
Scott
Pelly
betrayed
his
bias
there,
you
know,
that
he
thought
that
the
criminal
court
should
take
care
of
this
and
that
Washington
shouldn't
have
the
power
to
obliterate
these
people
based
on
a
secret

I
think
Pelly
did
betray
a
little
bit
of
his
belief,
what
say
you?
And
man,
I'm
just
on
the
other
side
of
this
one.
What
did
Scott
Pelly
do
that
was
wrong?
He
asked
a
question:
if
you
were
president,
Mr.
Gingrich,
would
you
sign
off
on
killing
a
suspected
terrorist
who
is
an
American
who
is
overseas?
And
who
hasn't
had
a
Gingrich
said
yes,
you
don't
need
a
trial.
If
a
panel
has
found
you
to
be
an
enemy
combatant,
you
don't
have
any
civil
rights.
You
have
no
right
to
a
trial.
We
can
kill
you.
And
Pelly
says
what?
He
says,
but
you
haven't
been
found
guilty
in
a
court
of
law.
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
what's
--
where
did
Scott
Pelly
cross
the
line
here?
Well,
I
think
he
said
the
"rule
of
law",
but
a
court
of
law;
basically
implying
that
if
you
agree
with
Speaker
Gingrich
then
you
don't
have
any
use
for
the
rule
of
law.
Look
the
courts
have
decided,
at
least
on
the
lower
courts,
the
President
has
the
power
to
order
these
assassinations,
attacks
--
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
He
can
do
it.
All
right.
So
that's
what
we're
even
adjudicating
in
the
legal
system
and
that's

Look,
this
is
the
way
the
system
works.
It's
been
defined
by
the
courts.
I
think
it
should
be
defined
by
Congress
so
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
--
that's
what
my
belief
is
but
Pelly
seems
to
think
that
it
is
a
violation
of
rule
of
law
because
that's
what

Well,
he
may
be
right,
you
know.
Because
I
got
off
the
phone
just
minutes
ago
with
Judge
Napolitano,
somebody
who
is
pretty
knowledgeable
about
things
like
this.
He
says
at
absolute
best
it's
unsettled
law
and
frankly,
according
to
Judge
Napolitano
you
ar
I'm
willing
to
accept
that
it's
unsettled.
But
I'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
all
my
conservative
friends
who
I
have
tremendous
respect
for
and
by
the
way
I
have
tremendous
respect
for
Newt
Gingrich.
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
where
did
Scott
Pelly
--
w
I
mean
a
moderator
is
supposed
to
ask
questions.
He
asked
a
legitimate
question.
He
asked
follow-ups
about
--
well,
he
wasn't.
Gingrich
brought
up
the
term
"guilty".
Gingrich
said
"guilty"
and
Scott
Pelly
said
and
I
think
you
would
have
said,
Bill.
Well
n
--
based
upon
the
ACLU
lawsuit
and
the
others
that
had
been
slapped
out
because
I
would
have
gone
by
the
unsettled
deal.
Courts
have
not
said
you
can't
do
that
so
that's
what
happened.
Last
night
at
the
republic
debate
some
of
the
hopefuls
--
they
hope
to
get
your
job
--
they
defended
the
practice
of
waterboarding
which
is
a
practice
that
you
banned
in
2009.
Herman
Cain
said,
quote,
"I
don't
see
that
as
torture"
and
Michele
Bachmann
said
that
it's
quote,
"very
effective."
So
I'm
wondering
if
you
think
that
they
are
uninformed,
out
of
touch
or
irresponsible?
That's
a
multiple
choice
question,
isn't
it?
Let
me
just
say
this,
they
are
wrong.
All
right.
A
lot
of
people
say
look,
the
CNN
reporter
is
sympathetic
to
President
Obama's
point
of
view
by
baiting
him
that
way,
and
you
say?
Well,
when
I
first
saw
this
I
thought
it
was
a
"Saturday
Night
Live"
comedy
routine.
Are
you
kidding?
I
mean
a
reporter
from
a
major
news
organization
asking
if
Republicans
are
uninformed,
out
of
touch,
or
irresponsible.
President
Obama
even
looked
embarr
He
looked
a
little
perplexed.
During
that
pause
I
thought
he
was
going
to
say
hey
man,
listen
I
know
you
guys
love
me
and
for
good
reason
you
love
me
but
this
is
embarrassing.
Look,
I
have
followed
this
for
decades.
And
I
don't
think
I
have
ever
seen
a
case
as
so
unvarnished
in
terms
of
bias
as
this.
I
have
said
on
this
program
more
than
once,
Bill
--
I've
said
on
this
program
that
bias
is
rarely
blatant.
This
is
jaw-droppingly
The
only
escape
hatch
that
Mr.
Lothian
has
is
if
he
was
going
for
this
big
reaction,
you
know.
He
wanted
to
provoke
Barack
Obama
to
say
hey
these
people
are
pinheads.
He
has
no
escape
hatch.
That
was
the
most
ridiculous
question
I
have
ever
heard
by
a
regular
reporter
from
a
so-called
mainstream
news
outfit,
ever.
President
Obama
will
leave
his
vacation
spot
in
Hawaii
and
fly
back
home
to
Washington
later
this
evening.
Some
of
the
president's
staunchest
supporters
are
some
of
these
harshest
critics
tonight.
They're
upset
that
the
president
has
signed
a
defense
auth
The
president
also
issued
a
signing
statement
expressing
serious
reservations
about
those
elements.
During
his
campaign
four
years
ago,
then
Senator
Obama
was
critical
of
his
predecessor
for
issuing
such
statement.
I
taught
the
constitution
for
ten
years.
I
believe
in
the
constitution,
and
I
will
obey
the
constitution
of
the
United
States.
We're
not
going
to
use
signing
statements
as
a
way
of
doing
an
end-run
around
Congress.
The
White
House
declined
to
give
us
a
comment
today.
Now,
more
on
the
reaction
to
the
president's
decision,
from
chief
intelligence
correspondent,
Catherine
Herridge.
In
a
scathing
statement,
the
head
of
the
ACLU
said
that
Mr.
Obama's
decision
to
sign
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
or
NDAA,
including
the
controversial
detainee
provisions,
would
tarnish
his
presidency,
quote,
"President
Obama's
action
is
a

The
National
Muslim
rights
group,
CAIR,
slammed
the
legislation,
quote,
"As
a
stain
on
our
nation's
history,
one
that
will
ultimately
be
viewed
with
embarrassment
and
shamed."
Human
rights

the
president
even
before
the

was
signed.
Codifying

The

the

any
prospect
of
relocating

New

in
this
1,800-word

the

seemed
to
emphasize
the
point,
quote,
"My
administration
will
not
authorize
the
indefinite
military
detention

trial
of
American
citizens."
While
voicing
reservations,
Mr.
Obama
signed
the
act
because
it
guarantees
continued
military
funding,
and
he
promised
the
provisions
would
comply,
quote,
"with
the
constitution,
the
laws
of
war,
and
other
applicable

of

are

that

You've

dozens

The
United
States
does
not
negotiate
with
terrorists,
but
there
are
questions
tonight
about
whether
that
is
actually
true
in
one
particular
case.
Here
is
chief
intelligence
correspondent,
Catherine
Herridge.
The
Republican
chair
of
the
House
Intelligence
Committee
was
blunt.
If
this
happens,
we
have
crossed
a
red
line
that
we
will
never
be
able
to
get
back.
Congressman
Mike
Rodgers
went
further,
claiming
the
Obama
administration's
proposed
transfer
of
five
Taliban
leaders
from
Guantanamo
Bay
as
part
of
a
confidence
building
measure
to
engage
the
Afghan
Taliban
in
peace
talks
was
beyond
the
talking
phase.
There
have
been
operational
things
that
have
been
conducted
up
to
this
point.
So,
this
isn't
an
aspirational
policy
change.
This
is
something
that
is
well
underway.
While
it's
not
clear
where
the
men
will
be
sent
and
how
they
would
be
held,
Fox
News
has
learned
that
the
five
detainees
hand
picked
by
the
Taliban
were
deemed
too
dangerous
to
transfer
from
Guantanamo
after
the
administration's
2009
review.
When
asked
whether
the
administration
was
looking
at
the
same
assessments
as
the
committee,
the
nation's
top
intelligence
advisor
punted
to
the
White
House.
Whether
or
not
we
negotiate
and
with
whom
we
negotiate
and
the
terms
of
a
negotiation
is
not
an
intelligence
community
call,
it's
a
policy
issue.
Sources
familiar
with
the
intelligence
say
the
five
Taliban
leaders
are
serious
players
in
their
organization
with
U.S.
blood
on
their
hands.
Questioning
CIA
director,
David
Petraeus,
Rodgers
made
the
case
of

the
men
for

aid
al
Qa
The
Taliban
continues
today
to
have
some
relationship
with
AQ,
some
logistics,
finances,
recruiting,
sharing
bases,
sharing
training,
those
kinds
of
things.
Is
that
correct?
In
a
statement
on
the
proposed
swap,
a
White
House
spokesman
insisted,
quote,
"We
haven't
committed
any
resources.
We've
engaged
in
diplomatic
efforts
alone,
and
we've
consulted
with
Congress
and
will
continue
to
do
so."
A
Congressional
official
told
Fox
the
administration's
current
plan
calls
for
sending
the
men
to
a
third
country,
most
likely
the
gulf
nation
of
Qatar
(ph).
Earlier
this
week,
the
director
of
national
intelligence
said
his
comfort
level
would
depend
on
th
Yes.
All
right.
Wouldn't
have
happen
without
rendition
black
sites,
enhanced interrogations
and...
Right.
And
torturing
people.
And
torturing
people.
That
would
be
enhanced interrogation.
It's
not
torture,
you
are
wrong
again.
This
is
an
individual
who
probably
didn't
give
a
rat's
ass
about
having
water
poured
on
his
face.
He
never
believed
for
one
second
that
you
were
going
to
kill
him?
No.
Let
me
just
tell
you:
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
would
use
his
fingers
to
count
the
number
of
seconds,
because
he
knew
that,
in
all
likelihood,
we
would
stop
at
10.
So,
this
--
this
doesn't
sound
like
a
person
who
is
afraid
of
dying.
If
he's
sitting
there
counting
off,
he
knows
you're
not
going
to
kill
him.
He
knows
he's
not
going
to
drown.
Then
why
do
it?
What's
the
point?
I
think
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
waterboarding
and
sleep
deprivation
and
everything
else
that
was
done
essentially
got
to
him.
All
right.
So
Jose
Rodriguez,
again,
the
CIA
guy
who
designed
the
--
and
Khalid
sheikh
Mohammed
did
break.
He
broke.
And
so
did
the
other
guys.
I
think
there
were
three
others
beside
him
who
they
waterboarded.
All
of
them
broke
and
gave
information
that
saved
thousands
of
lives.
Yet,
the
left
still
says
this
is
torture
--
President
Obama
himself,
torture.
We
don't
do
this
any
more
as
a
nation.
It
besmirched
our
reputation
around
the
world,
which
I
don't
think
is
true.
What
do
you
say?
Yes.
We
look
like
abject
fools.
Waterboarding,
what
in
the
world
is
a
former
covert
head
doing
talking
about
all
of
this?
Why
do
we
have
a
CIA
that
has
to
put
up
with
an
administration
that
gives
detailed
description
of
a
mission
to
take
out
the
leading
t
So
you
think
all
of
this
stuff
is
unnecessary
and
damaging
to
the
country.
I'm
not
recommending
that
we
put
a
terrorist
up
or
string
up
a
terrorist
by
his
feet
and
gut
him
publicly,
but
I
am
saying
that
we
shouldn't
even
have
to
have
a
discussion.
This
shouldn't
even
be
remotely.
If
you
have
to
protect
the
nation
sometimes,
you
have
to
do
it.
We
have
puerile
political
leaders
who
would
engage
in
this
kind
of
discussion.
Yes,
I
made
the
same
observation
on
radio.
And
I
agree
with
both
of
you
here.
Let's
talk
about
the
President.
I
have
said
from
the
beginning,
I
give
the
President
credit
for
making
that
call.
Now,
first,
we
have
to
give
all
praise
to
the
Seal
Team
Six
tha
Waterboarding
is
torture.
It's
contrary
to
America's
traditions.
It
is
contrary
to
our
ideals,
that's
not
who
we
are.
That
is
not
how
we
operate.
We
don't
need
it
in
order
to
prosecute
the
war
on
terrorism.
And
we
did
the
right
thing
by
ending
that
practi
So,
you
don't
think
we
would
have
gotten
Bin
Laden
without
the
techniques
leading
to
the
intelligence?
Well,
and
the
reason
why
is
because,
there
is
a
clear
trail.
You
know,
there
was
someone
that
we
captured,
a
facilitator
that
we
captured
in
2004
that
told
us
about
Bin
Laden's
courier
and
gave
us
a
pseudonym,
Ahmad
al-Kuwaiti.
And
that
led
to
Bin
Laden
in
Pakistan.
And
eventually,
we
got
the
true
name
of
al-Kuwaiti.
But
without
these
techniques
--
the
things
he
opposed
wouldn't
have
allowed
him
to
make
that
decision.
Is
that
a
fair
statement?
That
is
a
fair
statement.
Isn't
this
an
important
part
of
this
discussion,
that
he
opposed
the
very
intelligence
gathering
methods
that
led
to
Bin
Laden
for
him
to
make
that
decision?
Nobody
seems
to
want
to
talk
about
this?
Well,
what's
important
is,
Mr.
Rodriguez
was
on
the
show
last
night,
he
is
the
one
that
led
the
enhanced interrogation
efforts.
He
knows.
He
was
there!
He
saw
them.
Abu
Zubaydah
and
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
All
right.
There's
one
other
thing
here,
because
they
denied
that
this
is
true.
But
Defense
Secretary
Panetta
admitted
it
in
an
interview
on
NBC.
One
last
tape.
Are
you
denying
that
waterboarding
was,
in
part,
among
the
tactics
used
to
extract
the
intelligence
that
led
to
this
successful
mission?
No,
I
think
some
of
the
detainees
clearly
were,
you
know,
they
used
these
enhanced interrogation
techniques
against
some
of
these
detainees.
So,
final
point,
one
final
time,
enhanced interrogation
techniques,
which
has
always
been
kind
of
a
handy
euphemism
in
this
post
9/11
years,
that
includes
waterboarding?
And
Mr.
Rodriguez
confirmed
last
night
that
they
led
directly
to
the
nickname
of
the
courier,
which
led
to
the
tracking
down
of
the
person
who
was
communicating
with
Bin
Laden,
directly.
Well,
you're
right.
Look,
we
have
heard
this
from
Mike
Hayden,
the
director
of
the
CIA,
who
was
the
guy
who
green-lighted
this
massive
operation
to
go
and
take
this
tiny
little
bit
of
information
and
spend
God
knows
how
much
money
in
order
to
track
it
to

And
we
ought
to
give
credit
to
the
CIA
and
our
allies
and
our
intelligence
agencies
and
our
military,
and
particularly
the
Navy
Seals
who
were
at
the
tip
of
the
spear
on
this
operation.
The
President
would
make
himself
look
bigger
if
he
made
them
look
big
You
know,
I
agree
with
you.
I
think
the
President
has
overplayed
his
hand.
His
re-election
team
has
overplayed
their
hands.
It
seems
like
they
are
running
on
two
things
now,
one,
the
killing
of
Bin
Laden
and
two,
the
auto
bailout.
You
have
some
other
issu
But
far
and
away
the
worst
insanity
I
have
seen
recently
is
sympathy
for
the
devil.
Last
night
on
"60
Minutes"
the
head
of
the
coerced interrogation
program
former
CIA
agent
Jose
Rodriguez
explained
to
a
skeptical
Lesley
Stahl
that
America
has
an
obligati
Rodriguez
said
yes,
a
few
al
Qaeda
big
shots
were
waterboarded
but
they
knew
they
weren't
going
to
die
and
yes
some
of
them
were
denied
sleep
and
a
few
of
them
were
kept
in
very
tight
spaces.
How
many
times
have
we
heard
those
activities
described
as
tort
We
don't
capture
anybody
anymore,
Lesley.
I
mean,
you
know,
their
default
option
of
this
administration
has
--
has
been
to
kill
all
prisoners.
Take
no
prisoners.
The
drones.
How
can
it
be
more
ethical
to
kill
people
rather
than
capture
them?
I
have
never
understood
that
one.
So
how
do
the
anti-torture
people
answer
Mr.
Rodriguez?
We're
blowing
the
hell
out
of
these
people
from
space.
No
trial.
No
presumption
of
innocence.
They
are
just
dead
and
so
is
everybody
around
them.
But
the
same
president
who
orders
that
will
not
dunk

"Talking
Points"
believes
the
President
well
understands
the
difference
between
drones
and
waterboarding.
His
decision
to
ban
coerced interrogation
is
simply
a
political
one
playing
to
his
crew.
It's
tough
to
make
a
sanity
argument
on
that
one.
And
that's
the
memo.
All
right.
One
year
after
the
raid
that
killed
Osama
bin
Laden.
A
former
high
ranking
CIA
official
is
speaking
out
and
arguing
that
the
harsh interrogation
techniques
that
were
employed
by
the
Bush
administration
played
a
larger
role
in
providing
the
inte
Jose
Rodriguez
Jr.
spent
31
years
in
the
CIA's
Clandestine
Service.
We
targeted
the
al-Qaeda
structure.
We
took
to
the
enemy
with
determination
and
we
focused.
In
a
new,
"Hard
Measures,"
Rodriguez
defends
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques
like
water
boarding
used
after
9/11
on
some
of
al-
Qaeda's
top
leadership.
The
poster
boy
for
enhanced interrogation
techniques
was
al-Qaeda
operative
Abu
Zubaydah
who
was

Zubaydah
was
questioned
using
these
procedures
and
soon
he
began
to
provide
information
on
key
Al
Qaida
operatives.
Zubaydah
identified
Ramzi
Bin
al-Shibh,
the
information
Zubaydah
provided
helped
led
to
the
capture
of
Bin
al-Shibh
and
together
these
two

Only
three
of
the
terror
leaders
were
ever
water-boarded
a
technique
seen
here
in
a
demonstration
but
Rodriguez
says,
the
interrogation
led
to
the
interruption
of
ten
large
scale
plots
and
the
capture
of
many
more
terrorists.
Honest
men
can
differ
after
whether
or
not
they
are
comfortable
with
some
of
the
techniques
we
used
and
that
is
fair
debate
but
you
don't
get
to
say
that
the
techniques
didn't
work.
But
some
did
say
that
they
didn't
work
including
then
Speaker
of
the
House
Nancy
Pelosi
who
claims
not
to
know
that
it
was
happening
at
all.
The
only
mention
of
water
boarding
at
that
briefing
was
that
it
was
not
being
employed.
And
she
seemed
to
backtrack
when
document
show
that
her
aide
Michael
Sheehy
had
been
briefed
specifically
about
the
waterboarding.
He
informed
that
that
briefing
had
taken
place.
No,
he
did
say
it.
He
said
that
the
techniques
were
now
being
used.
Controversy
erupted
again
in
2007
when
it
was
revealed
that
Rodriguez
ordered
the
destruction
of
videotapes
that
showed
Abu
Zubaydah's
waterboarding.
All
right.
I
spoke
to
the
President
this
morning
about
this.
He
has
no
recollection
of
being
made
aware
of
the
tapes
or
their
destruction
before
yesterday.
The
Bush
Justice
Department
had
written
extensive
memos
detailing
what
was
allowed
under
the
enhanced interrogations
and
why
it
was
legal.
Now,
after
a
lawsuit
by
the
ACLU,
those
memos
were
released
by
the
Obama
administration.
The
OLC
memos
that
were
released
reflected
in
my
view
as
losing
our
moral
bearings.
Rodriguez
and
the
CIA
were
eventually
cleared
of
wrongdoing
and
the
investigations
were
ended.
Joining
us
now
is
a
man
at
the
center
of
this
controversy.
Jose
Rodriguez,
Jr.,
former
CIA,
the
director
of
the
CIA's
National
Clandestine
Service
and
the
author
of
"Hard
Measures:
How
Aggressive
CIA
Actions
After
9/11
Saved
American
Lives."
Sir,
great
to
Well,
I
appreciate
it.
I
have
read
the
book
cover
to
cover.
We
can't
get
this
all
in,
I'm
going
to
try
to
get
in
as
much
as
I
can.
Let's
start
with
the
tape
that
we
just
set
up.
You
personally
briefed
Nancy
Pelosi
about
enhanced interrogation.
We
did.
We
briefed
her
before
September
2002
about
the
interrogation
of
Abu
Zubaydah,
so
we
went
through
the
techniques
that
were
used
on
him
including
waterboarding.
And
what
she
said
to
the
American
people
at
the
time,
she
lied.
Yes.
She
is
either
confused
or
is
lying.
OK.
Let's
go
to
the
mindset.
And
you
went
into
great
specificity
in
detail.
You
thought
that
you
were
flooded
with
intelligence
of
an
imminent
attack,
anthrax,
potential
nuclear.
Explain
the
mindset
after
9/11.
Yes.
We
were
very
concerned
about
a
second
wave
of
attacks
in
May,
2002.
We
had
a
flood
of
intelligence
coming
in
about
threats.
We
had
the
al-Qaeda,
the
anthrax
scare
of
a
few
months
before.
We
were
very
concerned
that
we
were
going
to
get
hit
again.
We

Yes.
And
so,
you
felt
another
attack
on
this
country
was
imminent
and
you
needed
as
quickly
as
possible
the
intelligence
to
save
American
lives?
Correct.
And
we
had
captured
Abu
Zubaydah
a
few
months
earlier.
And
Abu
Zubaydah
was
the
highest
level
of
al-Qaeda
terrorist
that
we
had
ever
captured.
And
you
thought
he
was
going
to
die?
He
was
severely
wounded
by
the
Pakistanis
when
he
was
being
captured,
so
he
was
near
death.
We
actually
brought
in
the
best
surgeons
that
we
could
find
and
saved
his
life.
And
then,
this
is
where
enhanced interrogation
--
one
thing
I
took
the
show,
I
watch
the
segment
on
"60
Minutes"
last
night
and
you
said,
"We
are
the
dark
side."
And
I
took
a
little
issue
with
that.
Even
though,
maybe
you
refer
to
that.
Meaning,
you
were
on
the
front
lines
of
extracting
information
under
the
circumstances
post-9/11
to
save
lives.
Why
do
you
call
that
the
dark
side?
Well,
we
are
in
the
shadows.
And
we
do
what
nobody
else
in
the
U.S.
government
does.
I
mean,
the
FBI
does
its
thing.
The
military
does
its
thing.
We
get
extraordinary
authorities
to
go
beyond.
And
we
have
very
special
authorities
to
do
covert
action.
For

All
right.
But
everybody
you
did
including
waterboarding,
sleep
deprivation,
food
deprivation.
Why
don't
you
walk
us
through?
What
did
you
do
to
Abu
Zubaydah
and
then
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed?
Tell
us
what
you
did.
Yes.
Well,
there
are
10
techniques,
they
were
approved
by
DOD
in
August
of
2002.
And
I
say
in
the
book,
"Hard
Measures,"
that
actually
they
were
pretty
wimpy
if
you
really
--
if
the
American
people
actually
knew
what
these
techniques
where,
they
would
say
And
slap
him.
Well,
that
is
number
three.
The
insult
slap.
You
know,
it's
a
slap.
You
know,
it's
not
torture.
And
it's
within
open
hand
so
it's
not
to
hurt
him.
But
people
take
offense
to
that.
You
know,
it
gets
their
attention.
They
are
naked?
They
are,
in
most
cases
they
are
naked.
Yes,
vulnerable.
There
is
sleep
deprivation.
Yes.
There
is
caloric
reduction
intake,
you
know,
to
put
manipulation.
There
is
the
facial
hold,
you
grab
it
by
the
face
and
you
again
make
them
look
at
you.
So,
those
are
the
conditioning
once.
And
then
there
is
a
couple
stress
techniques
where
you
sit
on
the
floor
and
you
put
your
hands
above
your
head
and
it
causes
muscle
To
make
them
as
uncomfortable
and
miserable
as
possible
so
you
can
get
information?
OK.
And
we're
going
to
get
into
what
we
call
waterboarding
next
but
it's
also
done
under
supervision,
very
strict
guidelines
and
you
only
did
it
three
people.
Abu-Zubaydah,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed?
Right.
And
Rashim
Nashiri
who
was
the
person
responsible
for
the
bombing
of
the
USS
Cole.
And
it
really
brings
us
inside
the
world
that
help
save,
on
my
opinion,
help
save
lives
that
some
people
deny.
And
we'll
let
you
make
that
case
when
we
get
back.
We'll
have
more
with
Mr.
Rodriguez.
And
welcome
back
to
Hannity.
We
continue
now
with
Jose
Rodriguez,
Jr.,
former
director
of
the
CIA's
national
Clandestine
Service
and
author
of
the
new
book,
"Hard
Measures."
All
right.
So,
you
talk
about,
you
put
some
guys
in
diapers,
they
were
nude,
sleep
deprivation,
loud
music,
food
deprivation,
but
everyone
talks
about
enhanced interrogation,
they
think
waterboarding.
You
did
it
to
three
people.
All
right.
Abu
Zubaydah,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
explained
what
happened.
The
first
thing
is
Abu
Zubaydah
and
he
is
a
very
tough
individual.
And
he
gave
us
early
information
and
then
he
stopped
talking.
And
we
were
dead
in
the
water
in
May
of
2002.
And
we
were
very
concerned
about
a
second
wave
of
attacks.
We
had
who
come
up
wi
So,
what
you
do
is
put
them
sideways,
you've
cover
their
mouth
and
their
nose,
pour
water
on
them.
You
can
only
do
it
for
what?
Forty
seconds
is
the
max
but
it
usually
lasted
about
average
of
10
seconds.
All
right.
Now,
President
Obama
has
called
this
torture.
He
wanted
to
close
Gitmo
and
he
ran
on
the
idea
of
ending
rendition
black
sites.
Here's
what
he
himself
said,
I
want
to
get
your
reaction.
I
ban
the
use
of
so-called
enhanced interrogation
techniques
by
the
United
States
of
America.
I
know
some
have
argued
that
brutal
methods
like
waterboarding
were
necessary
to
keep
us
safe.
I
could
not
disagree
more.
Make
no
mistake
we
will
close
Guantanam
I
strongly
believe
that
the
steps
we've
taken
to
prevent
these
kinds
of
enhanced interrogation
techniques
will
make
us
stronger
over
the
long
term.
All
right.
The
President
is
now
taking
credit
for
getting
Bin
Laden.
If
he
had
his
way
of
closing
Gitmo,
ending
enhanced interrogations
which
calling
people
like
yourself
torturers,
would
we
have
gotten
Bin
Laden?
We
got
a
lot
of
information
from
the
detainees
that
eventually
led
us
to
Bin
Laden.
And
that's
a
fact.
And
that's
a
fact.
You
would
there,
and
you
know,
and
you
saw,
you
watched
this
unfold?
What
concerns
me
is
that
there
is
still
doubt
out
there.
People
are
doubting,
you
know,
the
amount
of
information
that
we
got
from
these
programs
that
gave
us
the
basis
to
go
after
al-Qaeda
and
destroy
al-
Qaeda,
the
al-Qaeda
that
attacked
us
on
9/11
is
j
So,
you
don't
think
we
would
have
gotten
Bin
Laden
without
the
techniques
leading
to
intelligence?
The
reason
why
is
because
there
is
a
clear
trail.
There
was
someone
that
we
captured,
a
facilitator
that
we
captured
in
2004
that
told
us
about
Bin
Laden's
courier
and
gave
us
a
pseudo
name,
Akhmeid
Al-
Kuwaiti.
And
eventually
we
got
the
two
name
of
Al-Ku
So
the
president
is
really
not,
look,
I
give
the
president
credit
for
making
the
decision
to
get
Bin
Laden.
I
give
SEAL
Team
6
all
the
credit
and
all
the
people
in
the
intelligence,
but
without
these
techniques,
the
things
he
opposed
wouldn't
have
allowed
All
right,
let
me
ask
you
this,
what
do
you
say
when
you
are
called
a
torturer?
What
does
that
mean
to
you
considering
you're
trying
to
save
American
lives?
Well,
I
say
in
the
book
that
I
was
disgusted
and
my
colleagues
were
disgusted
that
after
we
stepped
up
to
the
plate
to
do
what
we
had
to
do
after
9/11.
We
answered
the
call.
We
had
our
president
basically
called
us
torturers.
There
was
a
controversy
about
the
water
boarding
of
Al-
Zubaydah.
Those
were
taped.
At
one
point,
you
made
the
decision.
You
felt
you
were
given
two
opportunities
where
they
told
you,
you
could
destroy
them
and
use
a
shredder
and
you
did.
But
people
said

There
were
92
tapes
and
the
tapes
were
done
actually
to
prove
to
the
world
that
we
were
actually
taking
care
of
Al-Zubaydah.
We
were
concerned
that
he
was
going
to
die.
Again,
we
realized
that
the
tapes
actually
had
the
faces
of
our
interrogators
and
they
If
the
tapes
were
to
leak,
the
security
of
my
people
were
going
to
be
compromised.
So
they
asked
me
if
we
can
destroy
these
tapes
and
that
started
a
three-year
ordeal.
You
had
a
lawyer
and
you
had
to
defend
yourself.
It
was
three-year
ordeal
until
I
finally
made
the
decision
--
To
go
ahead
and
destroy.
Two
years
later
that
story
leaked
and
there
was
an
investigation
and
there
was
a
special
prosecutor
assigned
to
investigate.
It
was
three-year
investigation.
You
think
that
all
of
the
people
that
were
working
on
behalf
of
the
safety
of
Americans.
It
wouldn't
have
looked
pretty,
but
you
think
their
lives
would
have
been
in
jeopardy?
I
really
do.
One
last
question,
you
saw
the
water
boarding
of
the
Abu
Zubaydah
and
Khalid
Shaikh
Mohammad
and
you
said
Mohammad
in
particular
was
a
very
evil
cold
individual
--
Khalid
Shaikh
Mohammed
was
even
more
of
an
evil
cold
murderer.
He
is
the
person
who
cut
the
throat
of
Dan
Pearl,
the
reporter
on
tape.
He
was
just
pure
evil.
He
was
looking
for
different
ways
of
coming
after
us.
He
was
the
guy
who
back
in
1995
came
up
wit
One
last
question.
If
we
abandon
these
policies,
are
Americans
less
safe
now?
Well,
these
tools
saved
us,
saved
lives.
I
am
convinced
that
it
saved
lives
and
allowed
us
to
stop
plots
against
us.
It
allowed
us
to
go
after
all
these
terrorists.
We
don't
capture
anybody
anymore.
So
we
don't
get
intelligence
anymore.
It's
a
mistake.
Even
if
we
captured,
we
no
longer
of
have
the
discretion
that
we
used
to.
Now,
we
are
bound
by
the
army
field
manual,
which
restricts
any
of
this.
Well,
thank
you
for
what
you
did
for
the
country's
safety.
I
know
you
will
have
your
critics
forever,
but
I
agree
with
you.
I
believe
you
kept
the
country
safe.
In
an
interview
with
"60
Minutes,"
the
former
CIA
officer
who
destroyed
the
waterboarding
tapes
went
on
the
offensive.
We
don't
capture
anybody
anymore,
Lesley.
I
mean,
you
know,
their
default
option
of
this
administration
has
been
to
kill
all
prisoners.
Take
no
prisoners.
The
drones.
How
can
it
be
more
ethical
to
kill
people
rather
than
capture
them?
I've
never
understood
that
one.
Supporters
of
Rodriguez
say
the
U.S.
government
has
gotten
out
of
the
capture
and
interrogation
business
now
relying
heavily
on
the
drone
program.
In
Yemen
alone,
the
number
of
strikes
has
more
than
tripled
since
2002.
The
former
director
of
the
CIA
says,
That
body
of
knowledge
on
which
we're
acting.
At
least
some
fraction
of
it
is
aging
off,
because
we
don't
have
that
extended
contact
with
detainees.
In
a
speech
time
for
the
Bin
Laden
anniversary,
the
White
House
counterterrorism
advisor
says
the
drone
program
is
legal
and
not
overused.
We
are
not
seeking
vengeance.
Rather,
we
conduct
targeted
strikes
because
they
are
necessary
to
mitigate
in
actual
ongoing
threat
to
stop
plots,
prevent
future
attacks,
and
to
save
American
lives.
While
enabling
the
CIA
program,
quote,
"torture,"
the
ACLU
is
also
critical
of
the
administration's
drone
policy.
And
so,
we're
simply
not
in
a
stage
yet
to
be
able
to
fully
explore
the
lawfulness
or
the
wisdom
of
the
targeted
killing
program.
But
what
we
do
know
should
give
us
pause.
And
in
the
"Impact
Segment"
tonight,
a
new
book
called
"Hard
Measures:
How
Aggressive
CIA
Actions
after
9/11
Saved
American
Lives"
causing
major
controversy.
It's
written
by
Jose
Rodriguez
who
was
in
charge
of
the
CIA's
Counter
Terrorism
Center
and
who
di
On
May
14th,
2009,
then
Speaker
of
the
House
Nancy
Pelosi
denied
the
CIA
told
her
that
waterboarding
was
being
used.
In
the
briefing
that
I
received,
we
were
told
that
they
had
legal
opinions
that
this
was
legal.
We
were
not
told
that
it
was
--
that
there
were
other
legal
opinions
to
the
contrary
in
the
administration.
And
we
were
told
specifically
that
waterboarding
wa
So
you
are
in
the
meeting
with
her,
right?
All
right.
You
tell
her
waterboarding
was
going
on?
I
--
I
was
the
person
who
led
the
team
on
September
4th,
2002
to
the
Congress
to
brief
here
and
Porter
Goss
and
some
other
staff
about
the
interrogation
of
Abu
Zubaydah
the
techniques
that
were
used
including
waterboarding.
I
want
to
tell
you,
I
want
to
rephrase
the
question
again.
Did
you
tell,
you
tell
Nancy
Pelosi
waterboarding
was
being
used?
Yes,
I
did.
Calling
her
a
liar.
Well,
she
is
confused
or
she
not
telling
the
truth.
I
think
she
is
not
telling
the
truth.
If
you
are
sitting
there
and
you
are
looking
her
in
the
eye
like
you
are
looking
me
in
the
eye;
and
you
are
telling
her
and
the
other
people
in
the
room
that
you
did
use
waterboarding
on
Abu
Zubaydah
and
she
then
comes
out
and
says
they
didn't
tell
me,
it
And
you
know
what?
They
don't
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
there
is
a
cable
dated
10th
September,
2002
where
we
spell
out
exactly
the
briefing
that
we
gave
Nancy
Pelosi.
Is
the
word
"waterboarding"
used
in
that
cable?
It's
used
waterboarding
and
the
other
techniques
that
were
used
on
Abu
Zubaydah.
Abu
Zubaydah
had
been
subjected
to
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques
in
August
of
that
year.
And
the
briefing
took
place
in
September
when
we
got
back
to
Washington
from

Ok
so
there's
a
written
cable
of
what
happened
in
the
meeting
saying
that
you
used
the
word
"waterboarding"
and
then
as
your
word
and
the
other
people
who
are
with
you
--
--
that
you
told
Nancy
Pelosi
that
that
was
being
used?
When
you
told
the
Congresswoman
the
Speaker
of
the
House
back
then.
Yes.
No.
She
was
not
the
Speaker.
She
was
Minority
Ranking
--
In
'09,
oh
no
minority,
right
yes,
that's
right.
They
had
just
come
in.
When
you
told
her
that
did
she
say
to
you,
Mr.
Rodriguez,
do
not
use
waterboarding
or
I
object
to
waterboarding
or
waterboarding
is
torture.
Did
she
say
that?
She
did
not.
What
did
she
say
about
the
technique?
She
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
technique.
And
actually,
the
way
I
remember
this
is
that
we
talked
about
other
potential
techniques
that
we
were
going
to
use.
And
she
objected
to
those.
You
know
there
was
a
talk
about
mock
execution.
And
you
know,
we
never.
Ok
you
didn't
do
it
but
you
said
you
might
do
this
kind
of
stuff.
Yes
and
she
said
well,
that
I
object
to.
Ok
but
waterboarding
you
are
100
percent
positive
she
did
not
raise
an
objection
to
it.
I'm
100
percent
positive.
Yes.
All
right,
now
you
know
who
Ali
Soufan
is.
I
sure
do.
Ok
he's
an
FBI
guy,
he
wrote
a
book
too.
Ali
Soufan
says
that
you
are
a
screw
up,
Mr.
Rodriguez.
Here
is
what
he
says.
"Zubaydah
gave
up
valuable
information
to
the
FBI
interrogators
including
information
about
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
and
they
obtained
information
that
led
the
CIA
and
the
FBI
to

Well,
Ali
Soufan
was
not
there
when
we
started
to
use
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
Because
they
start
--
All
right
so
let's
--
let's
walk
through
it
Soufan
says
that
the
FBI
got
the
information
about
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
not
the
CIA.
True
or
false?
You
know
the
only
two
things
that
Ali
Soufan
got.
The
one
thing
that
he
got
was
that
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
was
Muktar,
Muktar
that
was
the
name
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
had
used.
But
even
the
story
about
Jose
Padilla
is
not
so.
Ok
but
not
--
don't
get
ahead
of
yourself
there.
Who
--
who
interrogated
Zubaydah
first
who
you
or
the
FBI?
It
was
our
prisoner.
It
was
our
detention
facility
and
we
had
a
joint
FBI/CIA
team.
But
who
went
in
first
to
ask
him.
CIA
or
FBI?
It
--
it
was
a
joint
effort
and
we
went
in
together.
You
went
in
together?
Of
course
yes.
All
right
but
Soufan
says
that
he
got
information
from
Zubaydah
that
led
directly
to
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
without
the
rough
stuff.
It
did
not
lead
to
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
Bill.
But
wait,
wait,
wait.
But
once
you
started
the
rough
stuff
Zubaydah
shut
up,
is
that
true?
Well,
no
Abu
Zubaydah
basically
have
had
enough
of
the
FBI
and
basically
told
Ali
Soufan
to
go
home.
Basically
--
I'm
still
confused
did
Zubaydah
shut
up
after
you
waterboarded
him?
Did
he
just
shut
down?
No
because
we
did
not
waterboard
him
until
August
of
that
year.
Did
the
FBI
gets
very
high-valued
information
without
the
rough
stuff?
Did
they
get
it?
I
mean
the
FBI
and
you
did
they
get
--
The
only
thing
the
FBI
will
give
credit
for
them
to
get
the
nickname
of
Muktar
and
that
was
it.
Ok.
So
you
contend
that
Ali
Soufan
is
not
telling
the
truth
here.
I
contend
that
he
is
not
telling
the
truth
and
doesn't
know
because
he
was
not
there
when
we
started
to
do
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
He
doesn't
know
what
we
got.
We
got
thousands
of
intelligence
reports
that
basically
allowed
us
to
take
down

Is
there
bad
blood
between
the
FBI
and
CIA
on
the
terror
front?
No,
there
is
not.
Actually,
the
relationships
are
very
good
and
having
improved
with
time.
So
this
guy
is
just
a
rogue
guy,
this
Soufan
and
he
was
causing
trouble.
He's
a
difficult
guy,
he
had
difficulty
before
he
even
got
to
the
black
side.
He
had
difficulty
during
the
millennium
plot
in
Jordan.
He
actually
was
thrown
out
there
and
he
had
difficulty
after
he
left
us
and
he
went
to
Guantanamo
with
the
military.
So
y
All
right.
Well
the
book
is
fascinating.
And
I
have
to
say
anybody
who
is
interested
in
the
war
on
terror
you're
going
to
want
to
pick
up
"Hard
Measures".
And
we
appreciate
you
coming
in
Mr.
Rodriguez.
In
the
"Kelly
File"
segment
tonight,
three
very
controversial
stories.
We
begin
with
the
very
liberal
Ninth
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
dismissing
a
lawsuit
from
convicted
American
terrorist
Jose
Padilla
--
we
mentioned
him
up
top
--
and
his
mother.
All
right.
So
whenever
the
Ninth
Circuit
throws
something
out,
you
know,
you've
got
to
pay
attention,
particularly
when
it's
a
terrorist
beef.
What
was
the
claim
by
Padilla?
What
greater
vindication
could
John
Yoo
ask
for
than
having
the
Ninth
Court
throw
out
the
lawsuit?
Explain
who
John
Yoo
is.
Jose
Padilla
is
a
convicted
terrorist
who
sued
this
guy,
John
Yoo,
who
worked
in
the
legal
counsel
office
of
the
Justice
Department
after
9/11
under
President
George
W.
bush.
And
he's
the
guy
who
wrote
the
memo
that
his
detractors
called
the
so-called
tor
That
Mr.
Rodriguez,
who
we
had
on
earlier,
used
as
a
guideline
to
waterboard.
Jose
Padilla
was
arrested
back
in
2002,
thrown
into
a
military
brig
for
three
and
a
half
years,
and
claims
that
he
was
subjected
to
abuse
that
he
calls
torture
at
the
time.
He
later
went
into
federal
civilian
custody
and
was
convicted,
given
a
17-year
sentence
that
the
court
actually
then
struck
down
as
too
lenient
for
what
he
had
done.
He
wanted
to
set
off
a
dirty
bomb
in
the
United
States,
even
though
he's
an
American
citi
OK,
so
he,
while
he's
sitting
in
prison
and
with
all
this
time
on
his
hands,
decides
to
sue
John
Yoo
and
say,
"You
wrote
the
memo.
You've
got
to
pay
me
for
all
the
abuse
I
endured
in
that
federal
prison
--
or
in
that
military
prison."
He,
John
Yoo
has
immunity.
He
--
we
protect
our
government
officials
from
this
sort
of
nonsense,
because
how
can
they
do
their
job?
That's
how
the
court
ruled.
That's
what
the
Ninth
Circuit
ruled
on,
that
he
had
immunity
and
he
couldn't
bring
the
suit.
Yes.
They
said
--
the
reason
was
they
found
that
the
constitutional
rights
that
he
was
alleging
had
been
violated
were
not
clear
at
that
point
in
time,
and
unless
they
were,
he
has
no
lawsuit
against
John
Yoo.
OK.
Where
is
Padilla
now?
Do
you
know?
I
know
he's
in
prison,
Kelly.
Do
you
know
where
he
is
physically?
I
think
he
might
be
in
Colorado
serving
about
45.
They
upped
his
sentence,
as
you
pointed
out.
OK,
John
Edwards,
he's
got
to
be
the
worst
guy
in
the
world.
There's
nobody
worse
than
this
guy.
I
would
say...
Got
to
be
in
the
top
three.
Jose
Padilla
is
probably
a
little
worse.
You
know
what?
If
I
had
a
choice,
I
think
I'd
take
Padilla.
Really.
Really?
Somebody
who
wants
to
set
up
a
dirty
bomb
in
the
United
States
or
somebody
who
had
an
affair.
Did
they
ever
bring
up
the
issue,
were
you
opposed
enhanced interrogation?
You
opposed
to
Gitmo?
Did
they
bring
up
Mr.
Rodriguez
out
this
week?
Jose
who
says
that
without
it,
we
didn't
get
any
intelligence
to
get
Bin
Laden,
the
location
of
him?
I'll
tell
you
what
they
did
bring
up.
They
did
bring
up
the
opportunity
to
take
Bin
Laden
instead
of
killing
him
was
there
a
plan?
And
President
Obama
said,
we
had
that
kind
of
plan
in
place,
but
we
really
didn't
think
that
was
going
to
be
the
case.
Clear
But
let's
go
back
to
2011
and
compared
to
2012.
Because
this
was
really
important,
was
this
a
kill
mission
as
Leon
Panetta
says,
or
was
it
potentially
a
capture
and
kill
mission?
Here's
the
administration
contradicting
itself.
Watch
this.
Order
to
kill?
Well,
we
were
going
to
capture
him.
What
is
it?
They
couldn't
make
up
their
minds.
And
in
fact,
at
the
press
conferences
since
right
after,
they
were
contradicting
themselves
and
they
said
there
was
some
kind
of
resistance
and
that's
why
they
then
had
to
kill
him.
They're
working
it
back.
They
weren't

And
directly
--
from
enhanced interrogation.
Which
they
thumb
their
nose
at,
by
the
way.
Exactly!
And
he
has
said
that
enhanced interrogation
was
torture.
The
information
that
came
about
the
nickname
for
the
courier
came
from
enhanced interrogation.
It
took
two
years
to
track
down
who
the
courier
was.
They
also
learned
that
he
was
not
communicating
on
satellite,
phone,
cell
phone
or
computer.
So,
he
was
using
this
one
messenger.
That
was
pivotal.
That
was
key.
Obama
did
not
support
those
methods.
Tha
In
fact,
there
was
testimony
by
Jose
Rodriguez
who
said
KSM
and
Abu
Zubaydah
was
counting
on
his
fingers
until
ten.
KSM
would
count
to
10
because
that
was
the
average
time.
He
knew
that
they
were
going
to
stop
pouring
water
on
him.
So,
I
mean,
we
are
basically
telling
them,
we
are
giving
them
the
CIA
manual.
And
by
the
way,
telegraphing
when
we
plan
to
leave
--
we're
just
going
to
wait!
Oh,
I
that's
extraordinarily
well
said.
Now,
KT
McFarland,
but
first
of
all,
before
I
get
to
you.
Question,
how
many
of
you
went
through
the
same
experience
as
Colonel
North
and
were
waterboarded?
So,
we
call
this
--
President
Obama
calls
that
torture.
It
No,
it
is
not
torture.
And
I
think
there
is
a
second
issue
which
is,
did
it
work?
And
it
worked.
And
if
it
worked
and
it's
kept
the
United
States
safe
for
this
last
10
years,
even
if
it's
torture,
it's
probably
worth
doing.
In
other
words,
because
we
save
lives.
Debra
Burlingame,
your
brother
was
the
pilot
of
the
American
airlines
flight
that
went
into
the
Pentagon.
My
brother
was
an
F-4
carrier-based
fighter
pilot
who
was
waterboarded
at
SERE
School.
He
called
it
POW
School.
Five
of
the
pilots
who
were
killed
that
morning
were
ex-military
pilots
and
I
believe
four
of
them
might
have
been
waterboarded
as
well.
When
I
It
saves
lives.
Now,
it's
very
interesting.
And
we
will
get
into
this
with
Mr.
Rodriguez.
Congressman,
good
to
see
you.
Welcome
here
at
Sin
City.
We
appreciate
you.
Nancy
Pelosi
directly
said
to
the
American
public
that
in
fact,
she
didn't
know
about
waterboarding.
She
was
never
briefed.
Now
this
is
a
point
of
contention
in
Mr.
Rodriguez's
book,
but
this
is
not
what
he
said/she
said.
He
brought
with
him
his
lawyer,
s
I
think
she
should
be
held
accountable.
That's
absolutely
irresponsible
particularly
as
her
being
the
speaker.
But
she
is
on
the
intelligence
committee.
They'll
have
to
make
difficult
decisions.
But
the
rest
of
the
committee
was
briefed.
I
have
been
to
Gu
Yes,
I
mean,
I
think
the
bottom
line
is
does
it
work?
Is
it
not,
you
know,
is
this
torture,
because
it's
not
torture.
The
question
is,
is
it
effective?
And
I
think
we
have
seen
time
and
again
that
it
works.
And
if
it
works
and
it
saves
American
lives,
wha
They
put
Colonel
North
through
it,
I
mean,
you
know.
The
administration
trying
to
change
the
definition,
whatever
they
want
to
call
it,
man-made
disasters.
Overseas
contingency,
I
believe.
And
so,
they
try
to
play
this
over
semantic
games,
trying
to
change
the
wording
so
it's
a
little
bit
more
palatable.
But
we're
at
war.
We
got
to
fight.
Waterboarding
is
torture.
It's
contrary
to
America's
traditions.
It
is
contrary
to
our
ideals.
That's
not
who
we
are.
That's
not
how
we
operate.
We
don't
need
it
in
order
to
prosecute
the
war
on
terrorism.
And
we
did
the
right
thing
by
ending
that
practic
Now,
that
was
President
Obama
late
last
year,
declaring
that
enhanced interrogation
techniques,
like
waterboarding
are
in
fact
torture.
But
one
year
after
the
raid
that
killed
Osama
Bin
Laden,
a
former
high-
ranking
CIA
official
is
now
speaking
out.
Now,

OK.
So,
you
were
there.
Abu
Zubaydah.
Khalid
Sheik-
Mohammed.
You
lead
the
enhance interrogation
effort.
You
were
in
charge.
The
President
of
the
United
States
now
refers
to
you
as
somebody
who
was
involved
in
torture.
Your
reaction?
I
describe
in
our
measure
how
disgusted
I
was
when
I
heard
that
because,
you
know,
we
stepped
up
to
the
plate.
And
we
got
authorities
from
our
President--
The
Justice
Department
certified
that
all
of
this
was
legal.
We
briefed
the
Congress
and
--
I
briefed
her
personally.
I
led
the
team
that
briefed
her
personally.
So,
and
then
we
went
to
work.
And
we
destroyed
the
al-Qaeda
organization
that
attacked
us.
I
mean,
Abu
Zubaydah
was
the
first.
And
there
is
a
long
string
of
people
that
we
took
after
th
All
right.
If
the
President
is
going
to
spike
the
football
and
he's
going
to
accuse
his
rival
in
the
upcoming
election
of
not
being
willing
to
make
that
decision
which
he
did
in
this
ad
and
he's
going
to
go
on
the
one-year
anniversary
of
the
death
of
Bin

I
don't
think
so.
You
know,
the
last.
Wouldn't
have
gotten
them.
The
last
administration
advanced
the
ball
to
the
90
yard
line.
And
then
we
passed
it
over
to
the
new
administration
and
they
scored.
Yet,
they
spike
the
ball.
And
it
was
excessive
celebration
in
my
view.
Talk
about
Abu
Zubaydah.
Talk
about
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
Talk
about
the
waterboarding.
You
said,
KSM
was
tougher
than
Zubaydah,
that
he
was
evil.
When
you
saw
him,
met
him,
you
felt
you
were
looking
at
pure
--
The
personification
of
evil.
I
mean,
he's
smart.
He
is
a
very
smart
person.
But
he
was
looking
at
different
ways
of
killing
us
and
coming
after
us.
How
long
does
it
take
to
break
somebody?
I
mean,
the
techniques
are
what?
Sleep
deprivation,
changing
their
diet
--
There
is
conditioning
techniques,
like
initial
sleep
deprivation
and
white
noise
and
dietary
manipulation.
There's
corrective
measures
when
you
grab
the
person
and
he
understands
that,
you
know,
it
is
a
different
set
of
techniques
here.
And
then,
there
ar
And
how
did
they,
both
of
those
guys,
I
think
Americans
would
like
to
know,
maybe
somebody
like
my
friend
Debra
Burlingame
would
probably
like
to
know,
how
Abu
Zubaydah
and
Khalid
Sheik
Mohammed
that
planned
and
orchestrated
the
death
of
her
brother,
how

They
succumbed
to
waterboarding,
eventually.
I
think
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
techniques
finally
got
to
them.
They
were
the
toughest
detainees
that
we
had.
And
particularly,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
But
interestingly,
when
Abu
Zubaydah
went
through
the
You
know,
that
it
turned
to
Debra
Burlingame.
Debra,
do
you
feel
a
sense
of
--
not
necessarily,
do
you
feel
good
knowing
that
these
decisions
were
made
to
prevent
other
people
from
having
to
go
through
and
suffer
what
you
and
your
family
suffered?
Absolutely.
I
think
these
methods
were
justified.
And
it's
not
about
vindication
for
my
brother
and
the
people
that
were
killed.
It
is
about,
I
don't
want
any
other
brothers,
fathers,
sons
--
Yes.
It
is
saving
lives.
I
commend
Jose
Rodriguez
and
all
of
his

colleagues,
nameless,
faceless
colleagues
that
we
will
never
know.
But
I
believe
Americans
are
alive
today
and
possibly
westerners
elsewhere
in
the
world
and
our
own
troops
because
of
thi
That's
a
good
point.
Well,
more
people
were
waterboarded
in
this
room
than
we
waterboarded
in
the
whole
time.
The
only
one
that
liked
it
was
Colonel
North.
I'm
sorry.
We
are
good
friends.
All
right.
Thank
you
for
all
you
did.
Thank
you
for
being
with
us.
And
coming
up
next,
although
President
Obama
wants
to
pat
himself
on
the
back
of
the
killing
of
the
al-Qaeda
terror
mastermind,
it's
the
Navy
SEALs
who
deserve
all
the
credit.
I'm
going
to
be
joined
by
three
former
members

that

Plenty
more
ahead
as
the
FACTOR
moves
along
this
evening.
Verbal
brawl
between
the
CIA
and
the
FBI
over
waterboarding.
We'll
hear
the
FBI's
point
of
view
this
evening.
"Factor
Follow-up"
segment
tonight,
last
week
we
interviewed
Jose
Rodriguez,
the
man
who
was
in
charge
of
CIA's
coerced interrogation
program
that
waterboarded
three
captured
terrorists.
I
asked
Mr.
Rodriguez
about
a
former
book
by
former
FBI
agent
Ali
Soufan,
who
criticizes
harsh interrogation.
Soufan
says
that
he
got
information
from
Zubaydah
that
led
directly
to
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
without
the
rough
stuff.
It
did
not
lead
to
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
Bill.
So
you
contend
that
Ali
Soufan
is
not
telling
the
truth
here?
I
contend
that
he's
not
telling
the
truth.
And
he
doesn't
know,
because
he
was
not
there
when
we
started
to
do
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
He
doesn't
know
what
we
got.
Well,
here
now
to
reply
is
Mr.
Soufan,
the
author
of
the
book,
"The
Black
Banners:
The
Inside
Story
of
9/11
and
the
War
against
al
Qaeda."
You
know,
Mr.
Rodriguez
is
totally
wrong
here.
As
FBI
agents
we
are
trained
to
deal
with
facts.
And
let's
stick
with
the
facts.
He
said
on
your
show
that
enhanced interrogation
techniques
started
in
August
of
2002.
Mr.
Padilla
was
arrested
in
May
of
2002.
So
it's
physically
impossible
that
the
information
that
arrested
the
alleged
dirty
bomber,
Jose
Padilla.
The
information
we
got
from
Mr.
Padilla,
the
joint
CIA-FBI
team
without
enhanced interrogation
techniques
in
April
of
2002.
Same
thing
with
Mr.
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
KSM
was
identified
by
us
in
early
April
of
2002
before
even
the
contractors,
the
two
co
So
he
says,
though,
that
you
weren't
on
the
site.
You
didn't
know
what
the
CIA
got
out
of
Zubaydah,
Ramzi
Binalshibh,
and
then
ultimately,
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
Is
that
true,
you
weren't
on
site?
I
was
on
the
site
at
the
beginning.
The
FBI
pulled
us
out
from
the
site.
All
right.
So
you
were
there
in
the
beginning
and
who
was
present?
What
terrorist
was
present?
OK,
Zubaydah
was
present.
And
you
there
were
in
the
beginning.
And
the
FBI
and
the
CIA
there
--
were
there
together?
At
that
point
you
weren't
roughing
them
up.
You
weren't
doing
waterboarding.
You
were
just
interrogating
as
you
would
anywhere?
But
you
can't
tell
me
where.
Can
you
tell
me
whether
it
was
overseas?
OK,
that's
what
I
thought.
All
right.
So
then
they
pulled
you
out,
OK?
And
then
Rodriguez
and
his
guys
went
in.
And
they
waterboarded
Zubaydah.
And
they
say
that
the
information
they
got
from
Zubaydah
led
to
the
capture
of
other
terrorists,
including
Khalid
Shaikh
Mohammed.
Well,
that
is
factually
not
the
truth
either.
How
do
you
know
that,
though?
Well,
you
know
what?
I'm
still
working
with
the
military
commissions
on
the
prosecutions
on
Guantanamo
Bay.
And
I
know
the
information
that
we
got
after.
And
on
that
point,
everything
that
they
told
us
about
the
efficacy
of
enhanced interrogation
techniques
so
far.
I
was
there
when
we
get
this
information.
That's
No.
1.
And
No.
2,
that
has
been
discredited,
what
Mr.
Rodriguez
is
saying.
Not
to
me,
though,
and
that's
the
important
thing
for
you
tonight.
Here's
--
here's
my
problem.
And
I
don't
want
to
take
sides
on
this...
...
because
I
wasn't
there,
all
right?
But
you
should
know
that
I
do
agree
with
enhanced interrogation.
At
some
point.
All
right.
But
you
weren't
there,
physically,
when
Zubaydah
was
being
waterboarded.
That's
a
fact.
Rodriguez
says
that
the
waterboarding
did
lead
to
very,
very
vital
intelligence
that
saved
thousands
of
lives.
I
don't
think
if
I
were
you
I
could
call
him
a
liar
if
I
wasn't
there.
Well
--
well,
I
was
there
and
what
they
are
giving
us
as
examples
they
got.
They
said
they
got
KSM.
I
know
they
didn't
get
KSM.
They
get
--
they
said
they
got
Padilla,
the
dirty
bomber.
I
know
they
didn't
get
Padilla,
the
dirty
bomber.
And
more
importantly,
sir,
more
importantly,
the
CIA's
own
investigation
of
the
program
revealed
that
not
one
single
imminent
threat
was
stopped
because
of
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
So
is
the
Department
of
Justice
investigation.
So
is
the
Departm
Unfortunately
for
Mr.
Rodriguez,
today
we
have
volumes
of
documents
that
has
been
declassified
by
the
government
that
tell
us
the
truth
about
what
happened
and
when.
So
you
say
all
the
waterboarding
and
all
of
that
came
to
naught?
Nothing
good
was...
I
--
I
believe
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
having
compliance
and
cooperation.
Our
technique,
the
traditional
technique
that's
used
by
CIA
and
by
the
FBI
and
by
DOD.
Well,
the
bottom
line
is
you
say
we
don't
need
waterboarding.
I
don't
think
we
need
waterboarding
to
save
lives.
I
was
there.
I
testified
under
oath.
And
my
statement
is
still
the
only
statement
under
oath
about
the
facts
of
what
happened...
"Personal
Story"
segment
tonight.
A
couple
of
weeks
ago,
"60
Minutes"
featured
Jose
Rodriguez,
former
head
of
the
CIA's
coerced interrogation
unit.
Mr.
Rodriguez
has
a
new
book,
and
Lesley
Stahl
interrogated
him.
You
also
employed
stress
techniques.
There
was
technique
where
the
detainee
would
sit
on
the
floor
and
would
raise
his
hands
over
his
head.
In
other
words,
he
had
to
hold
his
hands
up
there
forever
and
forever,
right?
Well,
forever
and
ever
--
I
was
thinking
about
this
the
other
day.
The
objective
was
to
induce
muscle
fatigue
that
I
--
you
know,
and
most
people
who
work
out
do
a
lot
more
fatiguing
of
the
muscles.
Are
you
saying
this
was
like
going
to
the
gym?
Come
on.
It's
a
little
different.
No,
I
thought
the
interview
was
fine.
But
Adam
Corolla
disagrees
and
joins
us
now
from
Los
Angeles.
So
what
teed
you
off
about
Lesley
Stahl?
I
just
think
it's
so
easy
to
sit
back
in
the
cheap
seats
and
snipe
at
these
guys
that
are
trying
to
get
information
that
are
going
to
save
American
lives
and
maybe
European
lives,
as
well.
I
mean,
we
sit
around
and
we
go,
you
know,
Torture
doesn't
work.
Well,
it's
been
around
for
5,000
years.
Most
stuff
that
doesn't
work
goes
the
way
of
the
dodo
pretty
quick,
like
waterbeds
and
8-tracks
and
things
like
that.
So
my
question
to
Lesley
Stahl
is,
What
would
you
use
in
place
of
enhanced interrogation
to
get
information
out
of
people
who
are
trying
to
kill
Americans?
Now,
were
you
convinced
by
that
interview
that
Lesley
Stahl
was
against
coerced interrogation,
against
waterboarding
and
all
of
that?
Does
she
convince
you
of
that?
Because
she
never
said
that.
What
she
did
was
what
I
often
do
here
and
what
I'm
actually
d
Yes.
But
I
mean,
he
was
saying,
you
know,
I
slapped
him
with
an
open
hand
and
she
almost
(EXPLETIVE
DELETED).
She
was,
like,
What?
You
did?
You
--
sleep
deprivation,
diet
alteration.
She
was
making
it
like
it
was
a
big
deal.
Anyone
who's
rushed
a
frat
has
gone
through
more
than
that.
And
I
just
feel
like,
Look,
you're
trying
to
get
information
out
of
people.
You
know,
they
got
terrorists
in
there.
They're
trying
to
get
them
to
talk.
What
better
way
to
do
it
than
to
put
a
litt
Well,
look,
I
agree...
I
agree
with
you.
There's
two
tracks
here.
I
agree
with
you,
and
from
the
jump,
I've
said
that
if
you
have
a
captured
terrorist
and
you
can't
get
through
to
the
man,
I
think
you
try
to
do
the
conventional
way.
If
you
can't
get
through
to
the
man,
then
you
But
what
Lesley
Stahl
is
doing,
what
Mike
Wallace
did
very
successfully
--
and
I
do
it,
too.
You're
skeptical
of
what
Mr.
Rodriguez
is
saying.
You
go,
Oh,
come
on.
We
don't
do
that
here
in
America.
And
you
want
to
get
Rodriguez
passionate
in
his
defense.
You
want
to
get
the
juices
flowing
in
the
interview
so
that
he
gives
you
more
than
he
might
with
you
agreeing
with
him.
So
if
you're
going,
That's
right.
You're
right.
You're
right
--
if
you
go,
Com
So
what
Lesley
Stahl
was
doing
was
bear
baiting,
you
know,
putting
the
little
carrot
by
the
bear
so
the
bear
gets
angrier
and
angrier.
And
that's
a
technique
that
people
use
on
television.
You
don't?
Oh,
OK.
Yes,
all
right,
whatever
it
is,
I'm
just
saying
we
here
sit
in
our
safe
homes
and
watch
"60
Minutes"
on
television,
and
then
we
act
appalled
when
these
guys
go
out
and
do
the
dirty
work.
I
mean,
it's
their
job
to
get
information
out
of
people...
...
to
stop
the
next
9/11.
You're
more
angry
with
the
faint
hearts
who,
you
know,
don't
want
any
of
this,
and
they
--
Oh,
we
can't
do
that,
and
then
you
got
3,000
dead,
than
you
are
with
Lesley
Stahl,
who
basically
is
being
skeptical.
And
I
can't
say
--
I
mean,
I
don't
know
Ms.
Sta
I'm
just
saying
you
could
take
the
most
liberal
person
on
the
planet
--
you
know,
Michael
Moore
could
have
kid
with
Tim
Robbins,
and
if
that
kid
got
abducted
and
you
asked
them
both
quietly,
We
found
a
guy,
he
knows
some
information,
your
kid
is
buried
al
And
again,
show
me
all
the
bodies
from
waterboarding.
They'll
be
right
next
to
all
the
bodies
from
second-hand
smoke.
I
just
think
it's
much
ado
about
nothing.
In
the
"Factor
Flashback"
segment
tonight,
a
new
book
by
Jose
Rodriguez,
the
former
head
of
the
CIA
enhanced interrogation
unit,
says
that
waterboarding
suspected
terrorist
Abu
Zubaydah
in
the
summer
of
2002

to
valuable
information
that
saved
American
But
Ali
Soufan,
an
FBI
agent
who
was
initially
involved
with
interrogating
Zubaydah,
says
that
Rodriguez
is
dead
wrong.
Bill
O'Reilly
recently
talked
to
both
men.
He's
an
FBI
guy.
He
wrote
a
book,
too.
Soufan
says
that
when
the
CIA
interrogation
team,
headed
by
you,
Mr.
Rodriguez,
used
enhanced interrogation
techniques,
Zubaydah
stopped
cooperating.
Well,
Ali
Soufan
was
not
there
when
we
started
to
use
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
All
right.
Let's
walk
through
it.
Soufan
says
that
the
FBI
got
the
information
about
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
not
the
CIA.
True
or
false?
You
know,
the
only
two
things
that
Ali
Soufan
got.
One
thing
that
he
got
was
that
Khalid
Sheik
Mohammed
was
Muktar.
Muktar
was
the
nickname
that
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
had
used.
But
even
the
story
about
Jose
Padilla
is
not
so.
But
don't
get
ahead
of
yourself
there.
OK.
Who
interrogated
Zubaydah
first?
You
or
the
FBI?
It
was
our
prisoner.
It
was
our
detention
solely,
and
we
had
a
joint
FBI-CIA
team.
Who
went
in
first
to
ask
him,
CIA
or
FBI?
It
was
a
joint
effort.
And
we
went
in
together.
You
went
in
together?
OK,
but
Soufan
says
that
he
got
information
from
Zubaydah
that
led
directly
to
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
without
the
rough
stuff?
It
did
not
lead
to
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
Bill.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
But
once
you
started
the
rough
stuff,
Zubaydah
shut
up.
Is
that
true?
Well,
no.
Zubaydah
basically
had
had
enough
of
the
FBI
and,
basically,
told
Ali
Soufan
to
go
home.
Basically...
So
I'm
confused.
Did
Zubaydah
shut
up
after
you
waterboarded
him?
Did
he
just
shut
down?
No,
because
we
did
not
waterboard
him
until
August
of
that
year.
Did
the
FBI
get
very
high-value
information
about
without
the
rough
stuff?
Did
they
get
it?
I
mean
the
FBI
and
you?
Did
you
get
it?
The
only
thing
the
FBI
will
give
him
credit
for
him
to
get
the
nickname
of
Muktar,
and
that
was
it.
OK.
So
you
contend
that
Ali
Soufan
is
not
telling
the
truth
here?
I
content
that
he's
not
telling
the
truth.
And
he
doesn't
know,
because
he
was
not
there
when
we
started
to
do
the
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
He
doesn't
know
what
we
got.
We
got
thousands
of
intelligence
reports
that
basically
allowed
us
to
take
down
and
destroy
the
al
Qaeda
organization
that
attacked
us
on
9/11.
He
doesn't
know.
Is
there
bad
blood
between
the
FBI
and
the
CIA
on
the
terror
front?
No,
there
is
not.
Actually,
the
relationships
are
very
good
and
have
improved
with
time.
Mr.
Rodriguez
is
totally
wrong
here.
As
FBI
agents
we
are
trained
to
deal
with
facts.
KSM
was
identified
by
us
in
early
April
of
2002
before
even
the
contractors,
the
two
contractors,
outside
contractors
hired
by
Mr.
Rodriguez
showed
to
the
site.
So
these
are
the
facts.
So
he
says,
though,
that
you
weren't
on
the
site.
You
didn't
know
what
the
CIA
got
out
of
Zubaydah
or
Ramzi
Binalshibh
and
then
ultimately
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
Is
that
true?
You
weren't
on
site.
I
was
on
the
site
at
the
beginning.
The
FBI
pulled
out
from
the
site.
Where
was
the
site?
I
cannot
tell
you
that.
All
right.
you
were
there
in
the
beginning,
and
who
was
present?
What
terrorist
was
present?
OK.
Zubaydah
was
present,
and
you
were
there
in
the
beginning.
And
the
FBI
and
the
CIA
were
there
together.
At
that
point
you
weren't
roughing
him
up.
You
weren't
waterboarding
him.
You
were
just
interrogating
him,
as
you
would
anywhere.
But
you
can't
tell
me
where,
though.
Can
you
tell
me
whether
it
was
overseas?
Yes,
that's
what
I
thought.
All
right.
So
then
they
pulled
you
out,
OK?
And
then
Rodriguez
and
his
guys
went
in.
And
they
waterboarded
Zubaydah.
And
they
say
that
the
information
they
got
from
Zubaydah
led
to
the
capture
of
other
terrorists,
including
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed.
Well,
that
is
factually
not
the
truth
either.
How
do
you
know
that?
Well,
you
know
what?
I'm
still
working
with
the
military
commissions
on
the
prosecutions
of
Guantanamo
Bay.
And
I
know
the
information
that
we
got
after.
And
another
point:
everything
that
they
told
us
about
the
efficacy
of
enhanced interrogation
techniques
so
far,
I
was
there
when
we
get
this
information,
that's
No.
1.
And
No.
2,
that
has
been
discredited,
what
Mr.
Rodriguez
is
saying.
Not
to
me,
though.
And
that's
the
important
thing
for
you
tonight.
Here's
--
here's
my
problem
--
and
I
don't
want
to
take
sides
on
this,
because
I
wasn't
there.
All
right?
But
you
should
know
that
I
do
agree
with
enhanced interrogation...
...
at
some
point.
All
right.
But
you
weren't
there
physically
when
Zubaydah
was
being
waterboarded.
You
weren't.
That's
fact.
Rodriguez
says
that
the
waterboarding
did
lead
to
very,
very
vital
intelligence
that
saved
thousands
of
lives.
I
don't
think
if
I
were
you,
I
could
call
him
a
liar
if
I
wasn't
there.
Well,
I
was
there.
And
what
they
are
giving
us
as
examples
they
got.
They
said
they
got
KSM.
I
know
they
didn't
get
KSM.
They
said
they
got
Padilla,
the
dirty
bomber.
I
know
they
didn't
get
Padilla,
the
dirty
bomber.
And
more
importantly,
sir
--
more
importantly,
the
CIA
own
investigation
of
the
program
revealed
that
not
one
single
imminent
threat
was
stopped
because
of
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
So
is
the
Department
of
Justice
investigation.
So
is
the
Departm
Unfortunately
for
Mr.
Rodriguez,
today,
we
have
volumes
of
documents
that
has
been
declassified
by
the
government
that
tell
us
the
truth
about
what
happened.
So
you
just
think
all
the
waterboarding
and
all
of
that
came
to
naught?
Nothing
good
was...
I
believe
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
having
compliance
and
cooperation.
Our
technique,
the
traditional
technique
that's
used
by
CIA
and
by
the
FBI
and
by
DOD...
But
the
bottom
line
is
you
say
we
don't
need
waterboarding?
I
don't
think
we
need
waterboarding
to
save
lives.
I
was
there.
I
testified
under
oath.
And
my
statement
is
still
the
only
statement
under
oath
about
the
facts...
After
Bill's
interview
with
Ali
Soufan,
Jose
Rodriguez
offered
this
retort,
writing
quote,
"If
you
want
to
argue
that
the
information
gained
from
these
terrorists
was
not
worth

got
when
the

Good
evening.
I'm
Bret
Baier.
The

wanted
to,

and
close

terrorist
prison
to
try

in

courts

President
Obama's
kill
list
is
described
as
a
kind
of
yearbook,
full
of
photos
with
names
and
whereabouts
of
known
suspected
terrorist
like
Anwar
al-Awlaki,
an
American
killed
in
Yemen
last
year
by
a
drone
strike
ordered
by
the
president,
part
of
a
progra
It's
unlawful,
because
it
allows
the
president
to
kill
people
including
U.S.
citizens
far
from
any
theater
of
war.
It
is
dangerous,
because
it
sets
a
precedent.
Spokesman
Jay
Carney
was
pressed
today
about
how
a
Nobel
Peace
prize
winner
can
justify
the
program?
The
president
also
made
clear
from
the
outset
of
the
administration
that
we
were,
at
all
times,
going
to
act
in
a
manner
that
was
both
lawful
and
consistent
with
our
values.
The
president's
counter
terror
advisor,
John
Brennan,
laid
out
that
legal
justification
in
a
speech
last
month.
As
a
matter
of
international
law,
the
United
States
is
in
an
armed
conflict
with
al
Qaeda,
the
Taliban,
and
associated
forces
in
response
to
the
9/11
attacks.
And
we
may
also
use
force
consistent
with
our
inherent
rights
of
national
self-
defense.
Language
former
Bush
administration
officials
note
is
strikingly
familiar
to
the
Republican
justifications
that
Candidate
Obama
ripped
in
2008.
It
certainly
represents
a
180
in
his
direction.
So,
yes,
hypocritical
in
the
sense
that
he
continues
to
criticize
those
who
believe
in,
for
instance,
enhanced interrogation,
but
nonetheless,
does
this
which
is
far
more
intrusive,
I'd
say.
Republicans
also
question
the
timing
of
this
massive
leak
to
the
"New
York
Times,"
and
whether
it
was
aimed
at
making
the
president
look
more
hawkish
in
an
election
year.
Why
this
information
and
the
fact
that
these
people
are
targeted
has
been
let
out
to
the
press
as
somewhat
shocking
and
fits
a
pattern
of
abuse
of
sensitive
intelligence
and
national
security
information.
White
House
officials
insist
there
was
nothing
inappropriate
and
notes
the
president
more
direct
hands-on
approach
has
delivered
results,
most
notably,
taking
out
Osama
Bin
Laden.
President
Obama
made
clear
from
the
start
to
his
advisors
and
to
the
world
that
we
were
going
to
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
protect
the
American
people
from
harm,
and
particularly,
from
a
terrorist
attack.
As
one
former
top
intelligence
official
told
me
tonight,
the
president,
as
a
candidate,
probably
didn't
realize
how
compelling
the
intelligence
about
these
terrorists
is.
Now,
that
he's
in
office,
he
doesn't
want
an
attack
on
his
watch,
and
that's
why
in

Brit,
what's
your
take
on
this
"New
York
Times"
story,
this
massive
story
about
President
Obama's
kill
list
going
after
terrorist
in
this,
obviously,
an
election
year?
I
don't
see
a
political
problem
with
his
being
involved
in
the
decision
to
kill
these
people
rather
than
try
to
capture
and
interrogate
them
in
terms
of
the
politics
of
it.
But
there
may
be
a
long-term
problem
in
this
way.
I
don't
see
a
big
moral
problem

But
there's
something
lost
when
you
almost
never
capture
anybody
and
interrogate
them.
And
that
is
to
say
that
you
lose
the
possible
intelligence
value
that
these
people
may
have,
and
that
is
something
that
people
may
be
concerned
about.
It's
unlawful
because
it
allows
the
president
to
kill
people,
including
the
U.S.
citizens,
far
from
any
theater
of
war.
It
is
dangerous
because
it
sets
a
precedent
not
only
for
the
next
president
and
the
president
after,
but
for
other
countries
who
may
no
So
again,
those
arguments
in
2008
versus
where
it
is
now
and
the
volume
from
left
is
an
interesting
contrast.
I
might
add,
though,
that
there
is
an
important
point
to
be
made.
Response
from
the
ACLU,
which
is
that
it
is
not

Obama

saying
go
kill
that
person.
According
to
the
story
in
the
"Times"
there
are
hundreds
of
national
security
peopl
Failsafe?
He
is
the
executioner.
The
way
the
story
is
written
and
way
it's
reported
and
the
way
the
administration
wants
everybody
to
see
this
is
he
sits
there
with
what
they
call
the
baseball
cards
and
he
chooses
who
lives
and
who
dies.
I
can
assure
you

I'm
not
against
this.
I
think
this
is
part
of
a
war
on
terror.
But
the
idea
that
the
president
somehow
is
the
man
of
last
resort
--
he
decided
that
the
big
decisions
are
his.
He
decided
on
al-Awlaki.
And
he
also
decides
that
the
family
is
nearby,
are
you

The
way
to
do
it
everybody
agree
is
for
a
president
to
give
the
guidance
and
then
the
military
decide
under
him.
This
is
a
replay
of
that
with
a
high-tech
weapon
instead.
And
the
hypocrisy
here
is
absolutely
staggering.
He
went
around
the
world
apologizin
But
I
contend,
as
do
many
former
CIA
officials
and
secretaries
of
state
--
I'm
sorry,
secretaries
of
defense,
that
without

sites,
without

without

the
investment
in
the
intelligence

Then
what
do
you
think
of
the
President
politicizing
the
death
of
Bin
Laden
when
the
very
policies
he
supported
would
have
never
given
us
the
intelligence?
What
does
that
say
to
you?
And
it's
one
of
my
favorites.
You
know
"Moonlighting"?
I
love
that
song.

Al

that

suspects

that

for
days.

to
this

And
I
don't

all
the

and

and
hows.
But
I
do
know
this,
that
they're

from

a

of
it.

down

then
it's

isn't
it?
It
keeps
them
alive.
And
I'll
tell
you
what.
I'm
getting
sick
of
them
whining
that
they
are
being
tortured
by
cute
songs
like
"Sesame
Street"
and
the
great
rock
opus,
"Enter
Sand
Man"
by
Metallica.
These
are
good
songs.
You

on
the
Al

radio
in
your

Th
Yes.
I
can
understand
with
"Sugar

That
would
be
out

Then
you've

problems.
But
the
"Sesame

song
is
catchy.

of

as
a

one
has
to

Let
me
ask
Liz
this
question,
when
you

where

would

We
are

focus
on
the
extraordinary
series
of
disclosures
in
recent
weeks
of
highly
sensitive
secrets
on
the
U.S.
war
on
terror.
In

of

The
notion
that
my
White
House
would
purposely
release
classified
national
security
information
is
offensive.
But,
of
course,
the
president
can
declassify
any
information,
any
classified
information
that
he
wants.
Simple
question,
did
the
president
or
any
other
top
official
declassify
any
of
the
information
that
appeared
in
these
articles?
Well,
the
president
was
very
clear
about
this,
Chris,
in
that
interview,
that
he
has
zero
tolerance
for
this
kind
of
national
security
leak.
There
has
now
been
by
the
attorney
general,
two
United

attorneys
appointed
to
investigate
this,

he
has
not

that.

said
it

he's

--
he
did
not
say
that,
he,
in
fact,
said
he
did
talk
to
people
in
the
White
House.
Well,
for
the
book,
sure.
He's
a
prominent
national
security
reporter,
obviously,
who
is
writing
about
these
important
issues
facing
the
country.
But
there's
going
to
be
a
very
thorough
investigation.
The
attorney
general
spoke
to
us.
Two
United
States
attorneys
will
look
under
every
rock
here.

ought
to
be
investigated
as
thoroughly
as
anything
can,
and

to

for
the
results
of

I
do
want
to

you,

question.
Did
the
president
or
any
other
top
official
declassify
any
of
the
information
that
appeared
in
these
articles?
No,
the
president
and
his
national
security
team
--
first
of
all,
these
are
the
folks
who
waged
just
a
relentless
and
effective
effort
against
al
Qaeda
and
its
leadership.
We
decimated
most
of
the
top
leadership
including
bin

This
national

Forgive
me,
sir.
It's
a
yes
or
no.
Did
the
president
declassify
any
of
this
information?
No,
of
course,
he
didn't.
Of
course,
he
didn't.
He
did
not?
OK.
Let's
go
through
some
of
the
secrets
that
were
disclosed
in
these
articles.
The
CIA
had
a
double
agent
inside
al
Qaeda
in
Yemen
who
foiled
a
new
bomb
plot.
The
president
personally
approved
a
kill
list
of
terror
suspects
in
drone
strikes,
and
the
U.S.
and
Israel
launched
a
cyber
attack
against
the
Iran's
nuclear
program.
Here
are
some
of
the
people
quoted
in
the
articles.
I'm
not
saying
that
they
gave
up
these
secrets,
but
they
are
quoted
in
these
articles.

our

they
did.
Well,
let's
--
I'm
not
saying
it
was
Donilon
or
Daley,
but
there
are
people
quoted
by
these
reporters
and
they
say
that
they
were

of
the
national
security
team
who
are
in
the

with

Those
were
the
sources.
You
are

pictures
of
Tom

somehow
that
they
did
something
untoward
here.

they

in

of

So,
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
an
investigation
has
been
announced
by
two
United

attorneys,
including
an
appointee
of
President
Bush.

What
you
are
seeing
in

right
now,
by
the
way,
there
was
an
amazing
article
the
other
day,
I
believe
it
was
in
"The
Wall
Street
Journal,"
where
Republicans
in
Congress
are
openly
saying,
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
until
the
election
with
the
And
I
think
you're
going
to
see
increasingly
these
kinds
of
distractions
coming
from
Republicans
in
Congress.
We're
going
to
--
you
think
these
are
distractions?
Well,
my
point
is,
an
investigation
has
been
announced.
So,
let
that
proceed
rather
than
trying
to
suggest
--
Let
me
ask
you
specific
questions.
Back
in
Valerie
Plame
investigation
in
2003,
President
Bush
ordered
any
and
all
members
of
the
administration
who
knew
anything
about
the
outing
of
Valerie
Plame
to
come
forward.
Has
President
Obama
made
that
same
kind
of
order
to
all
of
you?
Well,
everyone
is
obviously
going
to
participate
in
the
investigation.
You've
got,
again,
two
United
States
attorneys
that
have
been
appointed
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
United
States,
who
are
going
to
look
thoroughly
into
this.
They're
going
to
talk

Has
the
president
ordered
his
staff
to
come
forward?
Obviously,
everyone
is
going
to
participate
in
the
investigation.
Let
me
ask
you,
you
say
everyone
is
going
to
participate
in
the
investigation.
Back
in
the
Valerie
Plame
case,
President
Bush
agreed
to
and
sat
down
for
thorough
interrogation
by
federal
prosecutors.
Will
President
Obama
sit
down
to
be
interrogated
by
the
Listen,
Chris,
I'm
not
going
to
get
into
that
right
now.
The
question
is,
this
investigation
should
be
treated
seriously.
This
is
--
Why
not
say
yes
if
he's
asked?
Chris,
I'm
not
running
the
investigation,
OK?
We've
got
career
law
enforcement
professionals
and
prosecutors
who
are
going
to
aggressively
look
into
this.
The
president
and
administration
want
this
investigation
to
be
as
thorough
as
possible.
But
will
the
president
cooperate
including
--
I'm
not
going
to
answer
his
particular
involvement
right
now,
Chris,
OK?
The
point
is,
everyone
in
our
administration
and
I
think
this
probably
goes
with
the
agencies
as
well,
of
course,
is
going
to
cooperate
with
the
investigation.
The
White
House
says
that
there
was
no
need
for
an
independent
prosecutor.
You've
mentioned
a
couple
of
times
now
that
that
U.S.
--
two
U.S.
attorneys
have
been
appointed
by
Attorney
General
Holder
to
look
at
that.
I
want
to
ask
you
about
this,
because
back
in
2006,
in
the
case
of
lobbyist
Jack
Abramoff,
Senator
Barack
Obama
sent
a
letter
that
said
this,
"A
special
counsel
will
insure
the
public's
confidence
in
the
investigation
and
prosecution
and
help
to
restore
i
If
an
independent
prosecutor
was
necessary
in
the
Abramoff
case,
which
quite
frankly
was
not
a
matter
of
the
national
security,
why
not
an
independent
prosecutor
in
the
case
of
our
top
national
secrets?
Well,
the
attorney
general
who
is
our
top
law
enforcement
officer,
as
you
know,
has
made
the
decision
about
the
best
way
to
proceed
here.
This
is
a
very
serious
investigation.
Again,
these
are
two
United
States
attorneys,
one
Bush
appointee,
who
are
going
Why
not
an
independent
prosecutor
as
Senator
Obama
said
to
insure
the
public's
confidence
in
the
investigation?
Listen,
I
think
most
Americans
would
rightfully
think
that
two
United
States
attorneys
looking
into
this
with
thoroughness,
with
resources.
Senator
Obama
didn't
think
so
back
in
2006.
Well,
that
was
a
different
case,
Chris.
And
by
the
way
--
This
is
a
more
serious
case,
sir.
Well,
there
is
an
investigation
proceeding,
OK?
So,
let's
let
that
investigation
happen.
Let
the
facts
come
out.
All
right.
Let's
move
on
to
something
else.
The
president
announced
a
new
immigration
policy
this
week
to
stop
deporting
illegals
who
have
been
brought
in
the
country
as
children
and
who
have
good
records,
no
criminal
record,
law-abiding.
Here
is
what
Mr.
Obama
said
last
year
about
not
having
the
power
to
do
exactly
this.
Take
a
look.
I
know
some
people
want
me
to
bypass
congress
and
change
the
laws
on
my
own.
That's
not
how
our
democracy
functions.
That's
not
how
our
Constitution
is
written.
We
continue
our
examination
now
of
the
recent
disclosure
of
top
U.S.
secrets
with
two
of
the
nation's
leading
experts
on
national
security.
As
you
look
at
these
extraordinary
series
of
leaks,
everything
from
the
double
agent
inside
al
Qaeda
in
Yemen,
to
the
details
about
the
U.S.
and
Israeli
joint
cyber
campaign
against
Iraq.
Let
me
start
with
you,
Senator
Lieberman.
How
much
damage
has
been
done
to
our
national
security?
In
my
opinion,
an
enormous
amount
has
been
done
to
our
national
security.
I
mean,
in
the
case
of
the
cyber
attack
in
Iraq,
if
the
articles
are
true,
this
is
the
first
confirmation
of
that.
Some
methods
of
how
it
was
carried
were
telegraphed
to
the
Iran.
I
In
the
case
of
the
underwear
bomb
from
al
Qaeda
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
--
again,
these
leaks
jeopardized
that
operation.
Potentially
put
the
individual
who
courageously
infiltrated
AQ
in
the
Arabian
Peninsula
in
danger
and
his
family.
This
will
discoura
Finally
in
the
case
of
the
Osama
bin
Laden
kill,
the
fact
that
we
leaked
the
story
that
a
doctor
was
retained
to
carry
out
a
vaccination
program
and
trying
to
get
DNA
from
people
in
bin
Laden's
compound
led
the
Pakistanis
to
the
doctor
and
he's
now
been

Who
is
going
to
cooperate
with
us
next
time
as
a
result
of
that?
So,
yes,
these
leaks
compromise
the
security
of
every
American.
WALLACE:
General
Hayden,
I
want
to
pick
up
on
what
Senator
Lieberman
said.
Are
some
of
these
leaks
giving
away
what's
known
as
sources
and
methods,
the
Holy
Grail
of
intelligence,
and
especia
I
think
so.
And
to
reiterate
the
point
the
senator
made,
these
don't
have
to
be
true
to
be
harmful.
So,
you
take
the
Stuxnet
story.
It's
almost
like
--
That's
a
computer
virus
that
allegedly
were
used
against
the
Iranians.
Right.
That's
taunting
the
Iranians.
Imagine
this
--
my
counterpart
when
I
was
director
of
CIA
was
(INAUDIBLE).
I
can
just
picture
him
now
going
to
the
supreme
leader
Khamenei
and
saying,
you
know
those
things
we
discussed
a
year
or
two
ago,
Mr.
Supreme
L
I
mean,
it
sort
of
legitimates
an
Iranian
response,
whether
the
story
is
true
or
false.
General,
in
the
cyber
warfare
story
that
appeared
on
the
front
page
of
"The
New
York
Times,"
you
are
quoted
saying
this,
and
let's
put
it
on
the
screen.
"This
is
the
first
attack
of
a
major
nature
in
which
a
cyber
attack
was
used
to
affect

Didn't
you
at
least
indirectly
confirm
the

No.
In
fact,
I
was
quite
clear.
Totally
agnostic
as
to
who
did
this,
but
it
is
accepted
knowledge
and
public
knowledge
that
this
happened.
Whoever
did
it
crossed
a
policy
barrier,
made
a
decision
that
in
a
time
of
peace,
one
could
use
cyber
weapon
to

But
in
you're
in
no
way
confirm
--
--
that
the
U.S.
was
involved.
No,
not
at
all.
OK.
As
we
discussed
with
David
Plouffe,
some
of
the
people
quoted
in
this
article,
not
saying
that
they
were
the
ones
who
gave
up
these
specific
secrets,

Question
for
you,
Senator
Lieberman
--
do
you
have
thoughts
about
who
was
leaking
these
stories
and
why?
I
don't
have
any
thoughts
about
who
is
leaking
the
stories.
But
we
have
to
try
to
find
out
and
that's
what
the
investigation
and
the
Justice
Department
ought
to
do.
There's
nothing
new
here
about
leaks
in
Washington.
This
happened
during
the
Clinton
and
Bush
administration
and
earlier
Obama
administration
and
Bob
Woodward's
books
for
instance.
But
the
recent
series
of
leaks
are
the
worst
in
the
long
time.
I
think
run
I
think
we've
got
to
change
the
law
that's
applied
here.
The
last
person
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
for
leaking
to
the
media
was
more
than
25
years
ago.
We
are

a
1917
Espionage

that
requires

showing
of
intent

But,
Chris,
if
you
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
ought
to
say
simply:
if
you

without
authority
classified
information,
you
committed
a
crime,
because
for

to
be

there
was
a

One

David

the

he's

He

that
his

is
based
on
conversations
with
high
ranking
officials
in
the
U.S.
government
and
other
governments
who
don't
want
to
be

because
the

highly

and

to

ongoing

Let
me
follow
on
this
with
you,
General
Hayden,
because
you
have
been

these

You've

the
Situation

How
closely

is

kind
of

You

we
are

about
sources
and
methods.
We
are
talking
about
agents
that
we
had
in
those
countries.
We
are
talking
about
a
major
campaign
against
Iran.
How
closely

is
the
information
and
do
people

Well,
they

And
this
is
very
closely
held
information.
Again,
without
commenting
on
whether
the
story
is
true
or
false.
If
you
follow
the
storyline

would
have
been

believe
what
David
Sanger
said.
This
wasn't
in
any
way
a
press
from
anyone,
so
to
speak.
He
picked
this
up
in
bits
and
pieces
through
very
good
reporting.
But
that,
however,
doesn't
indicate
that
some
of
that
reporting
didn't
come
from
sources
who
were
privy
to
this
information.
Senator
Lieberman,
let
me
ask
you
some
of
the
questions
that
I
asked
David
Plouffe.
Do
you
think
that
the
president
should,
as
George
W.
Bush
did,
order
his
entire
staff,
anyone
who
knows
about
those
leaks,
come
forward?
I
do.
I
mean,
the
president
made
very
clear
in
the
statement
that
you
played
earlier
that
he
was
outraged
and
anybody
would
think
that
anybody
in
his
White
House
who
was
leaking
classified
information.
I
think
the
next
step
is
ask
all
of
them
to
come
forw
You
think
he
should
agree,
as
President
Bush
did,
to
sit
down
with
federal
prosecutors
for
interrogation?
Well,
that's
up
to
him.
But,
look,
we
are
in
a
situation
where
I
think
the
administration
ought
to
do
everything
it
can
to
eliminate
any
appearance
that
people
in
the
administration
leaked
this
highly
classified
information
for
political
or
other
personal
And
I
leave
it
to
the
president's
attorneys.
But
If
I
were
advising
him,
I'd
say
he
should
sit
down
and
talk
to
the
investigators.
Finally,
back
in
2003,
you
said
that
we
needed
a
special
prosecutor
and
independent
counsel
in
the
Valerie
Plame
case.
Given
the
extent
of
these
leaks
and
the
fact
that
top
administration
officials,
not
by
name
but
are
quoted
as
having
been
the
sources,
d
Chris,
I've
been
thinking
about
this
since
these
leaks
came
out.
And
I
reached
a
conclusion,
which
is
that
we
do
need
a
special
counsel
and
we
need
a
special
counsel
because
special
counsel
avoids
any
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest.
Special
counsels,

So
you
are
saying
the
U.S.
attorneys
that
have
been
appointed
by
General
Holder,
Attorney
General
Holder,
not
enough
special
prosecutor.
Yeah,
not
enough.
And
I
have
no
reason
to
distrust
or
disrespect
either
of
these
U.S.
attorneys.
But
here
we
got
one
gentleman
who
gave
a
contribution
to
President
Obama.
No
matter
what
he
concludes,
people
are
going
to
say
it
was
biased.
Here's
the
big
difference
between
a
regular
U.S.
attorney
and
a
special
counsel,
the
special
counsel
is
not
under
the
day-to-day
supervision
of
the
Attorney
General,
he
is
really
much
more
independent.
And
I
think
that's
what
--
frankly
I
think
Attorney
G
We're
going
to
have
to
leave
it
there.
Senator
Lieberman,
General
Hayden,
thank
you
both
so
much
for
coming
in
today
to
discuss
these
matters
of
vital
national
security.
Thank
you,
gentlemen.
Up
next,
the
president
goes
around
congress
to
make
a
major
change
in
immigration
policy.
Our
Sunday
group
breaks
it
down
when
we
come
right
back.
In
the
"Back
of
the
Book"
segment
tonight,
Indiana
Democratic
congressman
Andre
Carson,
who
is
Muslim,
thinks
he
has
figured
out
a
way,
perhaps,
to
solve
the
education
crisis
in
this
country.
According
to
the
congressman,
America
should
model
its
schools

America
will
never
tap
into
educational
innovation
and
ingenuity
without
looking
at
the
model
that
we
have
in
our
madrassas,
in
our
schools
where
innovation
is
encouraged,
where
the
foundation
is
the
Koran.
And
that
model
that
we
are
pushing
in
some
of
our
schools
meets
the
multiple
needs
of
students.
America
must
understand
that
she
needs
Muslims.
There
are
over
7
million
Muslims
in
this
country,
and
while
we
are
under
attack,
we
cannot
retreat.
It
should
be
noted
that
many
of
the
Taliban
were
educated
in
madrassas
in
Pakistan,
of
course.
Hot
beds
of
recruiting
for
terrorism
around
the
world
and
complaints
we've
seen
even
in
our
own
country.
And
Congressman
Carson
declined
our
invitation
to
appear
this
evening
but
sent
us
a
statement
that
says,
in
part,
"While
I
do
not
believe
that
any
particular
faith
should
be
the
foundation
of
our
public
schools,
it
is
important
that
we
take
note
of
the
in
That's
not
too
controversial.
Mr.
Zafar,
it's
good
to
see
you.
I
think
when
people
hear
these
comments
from
Congressman
Carson,
while
his
clarification
or
his
statement
to
us
doesn't
seem
too
controversial,
they
remember
some
of
the
more
inflammatory
things
Congressman
Carson
has
said
So
they
hear
this
kind
of
stuff
about
madrassas.
And
the
next
thing
people
think
is
OK,
we
want
to
radicalize
young
men
in
the
United
States
to
become,
you
know,
Islamists,
what's
your
reaction
to
this
little
tempest
in
a
teapot
here?
As
you
know,
Laura,
the
Ahmadiyya
Community
is
a
leading
proponent
of
separation
of
religion
and
state,
including
public
schools.
And
we
met
with
the
congressman,
Carson,
last
week
at
a
special
bipartisan
event
on
Capitol
Hill
to
honor
the
arrival
of
our

And
based
on
our
interactions
with
the
congressman,
I
believe
his
views
are
consistent
with
ours.
I
don't
believe
--
I
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
he's
advocating
for
some
sort
of
Taliban-style
education
in
America.
I
understand
his
comments
to
mean
that
the
education
system
in
America
can
benefit
from
the
experience
and
the
curricula
of
American
Muslim
schools,
as
well
as
the
emphasis
on
education
and
rationality
and
pluralism
found
in
the
Koran.
So
that
statement,

If
I
may,
what
I
think
is
part
of
the
confusion
here
is
the
use
of
the
word
"madrassa."
But
that
Arabic
word
only
means
"school."
In
fact,
it
has
Semitic
origin
from
the
Hebrew
word
"midrash,"
and
it
has
no
sorts
of
implication
of
a
religious
affiliation

So
I
think
his
clarification
for
the
statement
is,
is
fair
that,
is
that
he's
not
advocating
for
an
imposition
of
Islam
in
our
education
system.
It's
just
that
we
can
learn
from
different
schools,
whether
it's
Muslim,
Jewish,
Christian,
alike.
We
can
all

Right.
I
think
--
I
think
--
and
he
himself
was
the
product
of,
I
think,
Catholic
education,
as
well
as
other
schools.
So
he
has
kind
of
an
interesting
background.
But
I
think
what
people
might
say
is,
OK,
if
an
evangelical
Christian
who
is
a
congressman
got
up
there
and
said
something
like
this,
he
would
be
excoriated,
or
she,
by
the
left.
"Separation
of
church
and
state.
How
dare
you
say
that
we
should
make
this
a
I
mean,
I
actually
think
religious-based
education
has
a
lot
of
values.
I
do
get
worried
places
like
Alexandria,
Virginia,
I
know
you
remember
that
controversy
from
some
years
ago.
They
had
to
remove
very
hateful
things
from
the
curriculum
in
a
Saudi-fund
Yes,
I
think
the
underlying
theme
is
that
religious
schools
--
Christian,
Muslim,
Jewish
or
other,
for
that
matter
--
have
seen
some
notable
successes
in
their
system.
And
I
think
it's
important
for
us
to
study
their
successes
and
bring
some

As
an
American
parent
myself,
whose
children
will
likely
attend
the
public
school
system,
I
have
a
vested
interest
in
our
public
school
system
being
as
effective
and
strong
as
possible.
And
I
think
there
are
things
we
can
learn
from
the
Muslim
educational
system.
Christian,
Jewish,
Buddhist,
even
atheist.
And
it's
bringing
all
the
best
for
our
own
system.
A
different
type
of
terrorism,
this
kind,
through
computers
has
lawmakers
and
security
officials
here
in
the
U.S.
very
concerned
tonight.
Chief
intelligence
correspondent,
Catherine
Herridge,
says
the
message

Despite
a
full
court
press
by
the
Obama
administration
to
push
cyber
security
legislation
through
the
Senate,
the
vote
had
52-46
fell
short
of
the
60
votes
needed
to
move
to
final
passage.
Maybe
this
is
time
to
cool
our
jets.
This
is
not
a
time
to
turn
them
off.
While
supporters
said
the
legislation
would
help
businesses
better
protect
their
computer
networks,
critics
including
several
Republicans
said
the
new
rules
boil
down
to
big
government
and
over
regulation.
The
bill
that
was
put
forward
on
the
floor
is
not
one
that
will
achieve
the
purpose
that
all
of
us
want.
Other
Republicans
complained
procedural
issues
derail
the
legislation.
And
we
decided
appropriately
given
the
complexity
and
the
number
of
members
who
have
expertise
on
this
issue
to
not
finish
it
today.
Those
who
crafted
and
supported
the
law
said
national
security
fell
victim
to
politics.
Once
again,
the
members
of
Congress
have
failed
to
come
together
to
deal
with
a
serious
national
problem.
You
see
efforts
from
bad
actors
across
many
seas
attacking
this
country
and
acts
of
industrial
espionage.
Given
Republicans
like
to
consider
national
security
an
issue
their
party
owns,
the
vote
was
vastly
to
those
within
the
party
who
believe
unresolved
issues
including
the
budget
and
tax
cuts
will
mean
cyber
security
does
not
come
up
again

I
am
very
worried
that
we
have
run
out
of
time.
And,
our
adversaries
will
know
that
we
failed
to
act.
And
I'm
afraid
that
that
will
embolden
them.

But
what
they
forgot
to
mention
was
that
it
was

Obama
who
for
years
opposed
nearly
every
one
of
the
programs
and
methods
that
actually
helped

community
locate
the
terror
mastermind.
Now
take
a
look
at
the
stance,
for

on
wa
Waterboarding
is
torture.
It's
contrary
to
America's
traditions.
It
is
contrary
to
our
ideals.
That's
not
who
we
are.
That's
not
how
we
operate.
We
don't
need
it,
in
order
to
prosecute
the
war
on
terrorism.
We
did
the
right
thing
by
ending
that
practice.
If
we
want
to
lead
around
the
world,
part
of
our
leadership
is
setting
a
good
example.
And
anybody
who
has
read
about
and
understands
the
practice
of
waterboarding
would
say
that
that
is
torture.
That's
not
something
we
do,
period.
Now
perhaps
this
week,
speakers
could
have
been
praising
President
George
W.
Bush,
not
the
man
who
opposed
his
predecessor's
aggressive
policies.
He
opposes
enhanced interrogation,
wanted
to
close
Gitmo,
said
he
would
do
it
on
day
1,
didn't
happen.
He
opposed
rendition.
Now
we
interviewed,
Liz,
on
this
program
Jose
Rodriguez.
He
was
there
when
--
when
the
waterboarding,
the
enhanced interrogations

I
asked
him,
would
we
have
been
able
to
find
Bin
Laden
if
we
had
not
used
the
intelligence-gathering
that
Obama
opposed.
Here's
his
answer.
So
you
don't
think
we
would
have
gotten
Bin
Laden
without
the
techniques
leading
to
the
intelligence?
Well,
and
the
reason
why
is
because
there
was
a
clear
trail.
There
was
--
someone
that
we
captured,
a
facilitator
that
we
captured
in
2004,
that
told
us
about
Bin
Laden's
courier
and
gave
us
a
pseudonym
--
That
was
what
led
to
Bin
Laden
in
Pakistan.
And
eventually
we
got
the
true
name
of
a
Kuwaiti.
But
without
these
techniques
that
--
the
things
he
opposed
wouldn't
have
allowed
him
to
take
make
that
decision.
Is
that
a
fair
statement?
That's
a
fair
statement.
No
EIT,
no
Gitmo,
no
rendition,
no
Bin
Laden
and
he's
taking
all
the
credit,
spiking
the
football.
Exactly.
First
of
all,
anybody
who
hasn't
read
Jose
Rodriguez's
book
ought
to
read
it
because
it
is
a
tremendous
contribution
to
the
reality
and
the
facts
of
that
time
period.
Secondly,
you
know,
this
president
his
own
secretary
of
defense,
who
was
the
head
of
the
CIA
said
it
was
intelligence
from
the
enhanced interrogation
that
helped
lead
us
to
Bin
Laden.
Leon
Panetta.
So
this
is
a
very,
very
serious
business.
Again,
I
just
want
to
remind
people,
we
prevented
attacks
on
this
nation
through
our
enhanced interrogation
techniques.
Barack
Obama
can
take
credit
for
Osama
Bin
Laden,
for
making
that
decision.
But
there
is
no
question,
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
White
House
on
9/11,
he
wouldn't
have
put
those
programs
in
place
and
there
is
no
telling
what
would
have
happened.
But
we
know
attacks
were
prevented
because
of
those
programs.
Working
through
the
legal
process
of
what
is
legal
and
what
is
not,
under
the
most
controlled
conditions
to
get
information
that
we
know
saved
American
lives
and
they
say
that
they
tortured
people,
terrorists.
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed,
et
cetera.
It's
outrageous,
Sean.
I
mean,
the
president
of
the
United
States
himself
a
lawyer,
should
have
been
able
to
look
at
the
legal
opinions
and
understand,
we
didn't
do
anything
in
that
program
that
we
hadn't
done
to
our
own
program
in
the
SEAL
training
progr
It
was
not
torture.
There
is
no
question
about
it.
You
know,
one
word
I
didn't
hear
mentioned
at
the
Democratic
convention
at
all
was
Iran.
If
you
want
to
talk
about
this
president's
record
on
counterterrorism,
you
cannot
do
that
without
saying,
all
right
The
author
of
"Hard
Measures,"
former
CIA
operative,
Jose
Rodriguez.
Just
to
remind
people,
Jose,
there
were
three
people
that
we
gave
enhanced interrogations
or
waterboarded.
You
were
there,
correct,
like
Khalid
Shaikh
Mohammed.
I
was
overlooking
the
whole
program
back
from
headquarters
and
I
did
travel
to
one
of
our
black
sites,
but
I
was
responsible
for
the
program
so
I
know
it
very
well.
OK,
you
see,
the
president
now,
he

That
is
correct.
Since
then,
of
course,
when

first
came
into

he
closed
down
our
black
sites
and
stopped
the

program.
We
basically
don't
have
an
interrogation
policy
now.
So
those
interrogations
led
to
the
nickname
of
the
courier
then
eventually
over
a
period
of
years,
you
find
the
courier's
real
name
then
he
leads
you
to

So
the

has
no
decision.
This
is
very
important.
All
right,
this
SEAL

member,
I
watched
the
whole
hour
last
night
on
"60
Minutes,"
very
impressive.
He
wanted
to
give
everybody
credit.
And
"60
Minutes"
just
glosses
over
the
fact
that
Obama
opposed
these
tactics.
That
this
woman
the
CIA
agent
that
predicted
with
pinpoint
accuracy
everything
that
was
in
that
compound,
she
had
been
working
for
years
for
the
Bush
administration.
They
glossed
over
a
very
important
part
of
the
story
don't
you
think?
It
is
an
important
part
of
the
story.
You
know,
I
am
glad
that
Mark

gave
credit
to
the
CIA
and
to
everybody

It
was
an
incredible
effort
by
the

Yes,
they
are
the
ones
that
put
their
life
at
risk
and
things
got
difficult
for
them
as
he
described.
But
for

the

is
so
of

of

about
it.

I
believe
that
the

would
have
its
hands
tied
behind
its
back
as
they
tried
to
do
the
intelligence
work.
I
think
that
we
have
given
up
an
incredible
capability.
We

being

the

that

you

Yes
very
successful.
Do
you
favor
it?
I
do
favor
it,
but
there
is
an
argument
that
I
also
think
had
some
real
legitimate
points,
that
by
killing
these

You
don't
--
you
don't
get
to

them.
But
in
total,
do
you
favor
the
killer
drone
attacks?
Ok,
so
you
--
you
want
to
kill
them,
you
don't
want
to
water
board
them.
You
want
to
kill
them?
No,
I
don't
want
to
waterboard
them,
hold
on.
I
don't
waterboard
people
who
we
don't
know
whether
they're
terrorists
or
not.
But
you
want
to
kill
them?
Well,
if
we
have
information
that
they
are
terrorists.
But
do
you
have
information
--
The
drone
attacks
have
gotten
how
many

al

leaders,
including
the
number
two

So
you
can't
say
that
those
haven't
worked.
So
you
say

them,
but
don't
waterboard
them?
If
you

of

But
if

But
they
did
know
for
sure
about
KSM.
Not
everybody
they
just
rounded
people
up
--
KSM
but
not
everybody
is
in

--
Not
everybody
is
on
Gitmo,
there
is
only
four
people
waterboarded,
all
right.
And
they
knew
that
they
knew
big
things,
all
right.
But
there's
no
evidence
that
information
brought
of
waterboarding
--
And
also
it's
interesting
that
Alan
on
the
left
is
arguing
for
killing
these
terrorist
which
is
no
due
process
whatsoever.
Look
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
nation
has
been
without
a
coherent
detention
and
interrogation
strategy
which
is
why
they've
been

It's
easier
to
kill
them
there's
no
doubt
about
it
as
we
saw
in
the
bin
Laden
raid.
I
just
want
to
get
the
predator
drones
here
for
a
second,
because
I
didn't
get
to
chance
to
explain
it
before,
we're
faced
--
they're
focused
on
individuals.
We
rounded
people
up
after
9/11
willy-nilly
and
just
put
them
in
Gitmo
without
any
due
process.
Yes
we
did
and
we
released
a
bunch
of
them
later.
We
had
real
intel
on
the
terrorists.
Well
we
released
a
bunch
of
them
later.
We
were
about
--
There's
so
many
of
them
went
back
to
the
fight.
Be
that
as
it
may,
the
predator
drones
kill
selected
targets
and
then
they
kill
everybody
around
them,
Colmes.
All
right,
so
come
on.
For
the
most
part
they
kill
selective
targets.
No,
that's
not
true.
They
kill
--
they
look,
they
drop
them
on
a
house
where
there
is
a
guy
inside
and
everybody
in
the
house
goes.
Just
like
the
bin
Laden
raid.
Everybody
in
the
house
goes.
The
women
went
and
bin
Laden
went.
So
let's
not
do
that.
And
also
the
bigger
point
is
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
threat
you're
facing,
you
always
have
to
fight
while
you
still
have
the
advantage
because
the
second
the
enemy
gets
the
advantage
or
leverage
--
All
right,
so
all
in
all,
though,
you
say
the
war
on
terror
really
hasn't
been
worth
fighting
the
way
they
did
it.
You
say
it
has.
I
said
yes.
This
is
a
fairly
volatile
situation.
And
it
is
in
response,
not
to
the
United
States'
policy,
not
to
--
obviously
the
administration,
not
to
the
American
people.
It
is
in
response
to
a
video,
a
film
that
we
have
judged
to
be
reprehensible
and
disgusting.

Now,
that
comment
is
just
pathetic
and
it
pretty
much
says
it
all.
We
are
dealing
with
an
administration
that
does
not
have
the
courage
to
stand
up
for
this
country.
We
have
a
president
who
is
operating
from
a
position
of
weakness,
a
president
who
refuses
Now,
FOX
News
has
confirmed
that
the
White
House
has
asked
YouTube
to,
quote,
"Review
the
trailer."
Now,
that
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
an
administration
strong-arming
a
private
company.
Why?
To
censor
its
content.
But
tonight,
we
have
learned
that
Google,
9/11
was
an
enormous
trauma
to
our
country.
The
fear
and
anger
that
it
provoked
was
understandable.
But
in
some
cases,
it
led
us
to
act
contrary
for
our
traditions
and
our
ideals.
We
are
taking
concrete
actions
to
change
course.
I
have
unequivocally
prohi
Mr.
President,
EIT,
enhanced interrogation
is
not
torture.
Without
EIT,
without
Gitmo,
you
don't
get
the
call
to
go
after
Bin
Laden.
And
this
was
a
dangerous
display
of
weakness.
And
we
are
now
seeing
the
fruits
of
this
reckless
rhetoric.
Now,
this
disast
I
also
think
it's
--
if
they
can
keep
the
focus
on
the
movie,
then
they
can
hope
that
the
governments
in
these
countries
can
do
something
to
sorts
of
tamp
down
the
violence
and
call
off
the
protests.
But
if
that's
their
goal,
I
think
they
have
it
precisely
backwards.
The
fact
that
the
Cairo
embassy
elevated
the
movie,
talked
about
the
movie,
issued
a
tweet
and
a
statement
about
the
movie,
I
think
raised
this
obscure
film
that
nobody
had
seen
--
I
watched
it.
Frankly,
I
didn't
realize
--
I
watched
it
after
the
controversy.
Obviously,
maybe
I
am
not
sensitive
to
it.
But
I
didn't
see
it
as
being
anti-Muhammad.
We
don't
know
if
there
is
a
movie
out
there.
I
think
--
I
think
there
is
a
narrative
about
it.
The
narrative
about
it
has
in
fact,
you
know,
gotten
into
the
water
supply,
into
the
bloodstream
in
the
middle-east.
There
is
no
question
it
has
now.
But
this
is
now,
I
think,
initially
because
of
the
comments
from
the
embassy,
then
the
fact
that
you
had
senior
administration
people
talking
about
it.
And
now
the
fact
that
you
have
the
White
House
talking
about
it,
blami
There
is
more
breaking
news
out
of
Washington
tonight.
The
Obama
administration
made
a
move
today
that
had
some
people
thinking
it
may
be
trying
to
revive
its
plan
to
transfer
some
of
the
world's
most
dangerous
terrorists
to
American
soil.
Correspondent
S
Today,
the
federal
government
spent
$165
million
to
buy
a
correctional
facility
in
Illinois
that,
for
years,
has
been
at
the
center
of
a
contentious
debate
over
bringing
terror
detainees
from
Guantanamo
Bay
in
Cuba
into
the
United
States.
In
a
2009
presidential
memorandum,
President
Obama
directed
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
to
acquire
the
facility
and
to
prepare
it
to
house
Gitmo
detainees,
sparking
heated
backlash
on
Capitol
Hill.
Lawmakers
sought
to
block
any
funding
that
would
cover
the
transfer
of
terror
suspects
from
Gitmo
to
the
mainland.
The
administration
has
since
vowed
not
to
place
any
of
those
detainees
at
the
Illinois
facility.
We
will
not
move
people
from
Guantanamo
regardless
of
the
state
of
law
to
Thompson.
That
is
my
pledge
as
attorney
general.
Skeptics,
including
one
of
the
most
vocal
critics
of
the
original
plan,
Virginia
Republican
congressman,
Frank
Wolf,
remained
doubtful.
You
can't
take
the
attorney
general
at
his
word.
And
that's
not
Wolf's
only
objection.
As
of
now,
you're
fined
violation
of
the
Senate
earmark
band.
And
if
you
have
an
earmark
band,
I
think
the
American
people
are
really
expecting
you
to
live
up
to
it.
Others
argue
that
the
$165
million
request
came
directly
from
the
executive
branch,
which
isn't
bound
by
congress
member's
self-imposed
earmark
band.
And
because
it
never
went
through
the
legislative
process,
it
doesn't
meet
the
definition
of
an
earmark.
House
Appropriations
Committee
chair,
Republican
Hal
Rogers,

a,

"backdoor
move

the

and
is
pledging
full
opposition
by
the
appropriations
committee.
Supporters
of
the
deal
say
there
have
been
bipartisan
support
and
several
Republicans,
including
Congressman
Don
Manzullo
and
Bobby
Schilling
have
publicly
praised
the
transfer.

Democrat
senator,

who

filed
today
in

with

with

to
Abu

I
mean,
anyone
who
saw
those
photos
and
saw
what
those
people
did
to
prisoners
in
our
custody,
had
to
be
just
revolted
by
the
disgusting
deviant
behavior
that
took
place.
It
was
a
stunning,
shocking
thing.
It
was

It
was
helpful
to
the
enemy
because
they
could
go
out
and
use
it
to
recruit.
And
I
just
felt
terrible
about
it.
And
now,
Guantanamo
Bay,
a
quite
different
thing.
It
is
an
exceedingly
well
run
prison.
And
the
folks
down
there
have
done
and
are
doing
an
excellent
job.
The
heartbreaking
thing
with
respect
to
Guantanamo
is
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that.

What
is
awkward
is
the
fact
that
for
whatever
reason
the

was
incapable
of
persuading
people
that
that
was
a
first
class
operation,
that
they
were
not

people,
they
were
not

people.

The
bigger
problem
is
what
they
do
with
these
prisoners.

has
expedited
the
process
of
trying
to

launched
a
comprehensive

of
seven

of

and
antiwar
activists.

what
were
they

for?
This
is
actually
a
copy
of
the
search
and

warrant.

were
going
in
because
these
people
they
suspected
were

attempting
and
conspiring
to
provide
material
support
to

terrorist
organizations."

And
when

came
out
and
spoke
yesterday
about
this,
he
talked
about
this
like
it
was

accident,
a
tragedy.

is
incomprehensible
why
he
couldn't

of

this
stuff
on
the

that's
not
a

is
a

was
invaluable.

the

side
and
the
political
side,

will
hear
Mr.
Gingrich's
answer,
complete
answer
to
Mr.
Pelley
in
""Reality
Check,""
coming
up
in
the
next
segment.
But
first,
joining
us
from
Miami,
the
purveyor
of
BernardGoldberg.com,
Mr.
Goldberg.

So
a
lot
of
people

Last
night
at
the
Republican
debate,
some
of
the
hopefuls
--
they
hope
to
get
your
job
--
they
defended
the
practice
of
waterboarding,
which
is
a
practice
that
you
banned
in
2009.
Herman
Cain
said,
quote,
"I
don't
see
that
as
torture."
Michele
Bachmann

"During
that
--
during
that
pause
I
thought
he
was
going
to
say,
""Hey,
man,
listen.
I
know
you
guys
love
me
and
for
good
reason
you
love
me,
but
this
is
embarrassing.""

Look,
I
have

I
have
followed
this
for
decades.
And
I
don't

I've

So
he
makes
a
statement
that's
perfectly
parallel
with
what
Jackson
said.
You
explain
to
me
why
nobody
would
attribute
hostility,
bigotry,
or
racism
in
the
Jackson
statement
and,
yet,
NPR
attributes
to
the
Juan
Williams'
statement,
and
not
only
attributes
What
are
the
allegations?
Well,
Cuba
and
Iran
called
on
Washington
to
close
Guantanamo
prison
and
investigate
alleged
torture
by
U.S.
troops
The
Obama
administration
is
reportedly
preparing
an
executive
order
formalizing
indefinite
detention
without
trial
for
some
detainees
at
the
Guantanamo
Bay
terrorist
prison.
The
"Washington
Post"
reports
detainees
and
their
attorneys
would
be
allowed
to

We'll
talk
about
what's
become
of
President
Obama's
promise
to
shut
down
the
Guantanamo
Bay
prison
But
he
remains
far
away
from
achieving
another,
closing
down
the
Guantanamo
Bay
prison
White
House
officials
confirm
to
FOX
news
that
administration
lawyers
have
been
drafting
an
executive
order
to
address
the
fate
and
legal
options
of
48
of
the
174
prisoners
still
being
held
at
the
detention
facility
at
Guantanamo
Bay,
Cuba,
known
as
Gitmo
These
are
the
men
deemed
too
dangerous
for
release
and
too
risky
to
try
because
the
evidence
against
them
either
remains
classified
or
was
obtained
through
methods
critics
have
decried
as
torture.
Striking
this
balance
between
our
security
and
making
sure
that
we
are
consistent
with
our
values
and
our
constitution
is
not
an
easy
task
but
ultimately
that's
what's
required
for
practical
reasons.
Aides
emphasized
the
president
hasn't
even
seen
the
draft
order
but
they
confirm
his
belief
in
the
value
of
indefinite
detention,
a
shift
from
his
days
as
a
candidate.
We're
not
a
nation
that
locks
people
up
without
charging
them.
There
are
those
that
have
been
evaluated
by
our
intelligence
community,
by
our
defense
infrastructure
and
we
understand
as
the
president
does,
that
there
are
some
that
will
require
indefinite
detention.
The
draft
executive
order
will
allow
even
the
indefinitely
detained
to
challenge
their
status
periodically
with
the
aid
of
a
lawyer.
But
such
protections
scarcely
mollify
those
wary
of
any
presidential
order
that
would
effectively
codify
the
concept
of
in
I
think
it's
unfortunate
that
President
Obama
has
allowed
his
principled
beliefs
that
he
articulated
during
the
campaign
to
migrate
into
a
more
exceptionalist
approach.
At
the
same
time,
the
House
and
Senate
Wednesday
morning
passed
the
defense
authorization
bill
sending
it
to
the
president
for
signature.
The
new
law
bars
the
transfer
of
any
detainee
from
Gitmo
to
the
United
States
for
any
reason.
And
analysts
said
it
will
likely
frustrate
the
commander-in-chief
in
his
ultimate
goal
of
closing
Gitmo.
If
you
cannot
transfer
them
to
the
United
States,
you've
got
to
keep
somewhere
outside
the
United
States
and
Guantanamo
is
the
best
place
to
do
it.
President
Obama
said
he
remains
committed
to
closing
Gitmo,
not
that
he
said
because
the
people
who
run
it
are
doing
a
bad
job,
but
because
it's
become
a
symbol
and,
quote,
"probably
the
number
one
recruitment
tool
for
jihadist
organizations."
